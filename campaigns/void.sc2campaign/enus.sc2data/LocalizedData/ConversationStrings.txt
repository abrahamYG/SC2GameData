Character/Attitude/ZealotAlarak=Fanatical, loyal, obedient, fatalistic
Character/Description/ZealotAlarak=Supplicants are the lowest ranking Tal'darim. They live to serve and die for those above them on the Chain of Ascension, at least until they gain enough power and influence to challenge them to Rak'Shir. They are fanatically loyal not to any single Tal'darim (though they will say they are), but to the Chain of Ascension itself.

VoiceOver/Alarak/Attack06=Vengeance is mine.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Death00=My wrath is not quenched! 
VoiceOver/Alarak/Help00=My blades have met the enemy.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed00=My patience runs short, Templar. Do not press me further.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed01=Are you incapable of listening? Or just comprehending?
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed02=So this is the zerg... the "great enemy" who brought the Templar so low? How utterly disappointing.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed03=Bow before your Highlord and submit completely to my rule. Really!?!
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed04=Oh, Hierarch. Is this how you spend your free time? No wonder these "missions" of yours take so very very long...
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed05=There are fates worse than death, you know. I could have you extract terrazine until you lose your mind like that fool Nyon.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed06=(huffs terrazine) The breath of creation fuels my every... what was I... what was I saying? I'm hungry.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed07=Hmm. Maybe I've got it all wrong. Maybe I should show a little compassion. Maybe Amon is just misunderstood... Maybe, maybe we both are.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Ready00=The hour of my vengeance has come!
VoiceOver/Alarak/What00=Speak. Now.
VoiceOver/Alarak/What01=You address the Highlord.
VoiceOver/Alarak/What02=How shall you serve me?

VoiceOver/Annihilator/Help00=Our foes grow bold.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Pissed00=In this desperate hour, all who are able to serve must do so--Even those who have fallen.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Pissed01=Identify our foe, and it shall be annihilated.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Pissed02=I must warn you, your taunts are ill-advised, Templar.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Pissed03=I once fought for the liberation of Shakuras against the zerg Swarm itself. I do not have sit idly and accept this abuse.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Pissed04=Do not force me to emerge from this walker and teach you a lesson.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Pissed05=Enough! <struggles a bit> Someone tell me how to get out of this thing!
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Pissed06=<frustrated exertion> You are quite fortunate these tubes are difficult to remove.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/Ready00=Adun Toridas. (Translation: Adun hide you.)

VoiceOver/Arbiter/Help00=This vessel is under assault.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed00=Ah, another soul in search of answers.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed01=We judicators are eternally grateful that our Hierarch has allowed us to serve Aiur once more.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed02=And yet, you Templar are still wary of our actions. Our desire to fight for our homeworld is equal to any other.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed03=You desire a lesson in time travel? Very well.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed04=To understand time you must first conceive it. Think of a flat circle. Now, imagine twenty five million circles intersecting that circle at different points from the center.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed05=This is not a hard thing, Templar. Younglings are taught this exercise...
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed06=(resigned)Perhaps we should begin again. <SFX: Rewinding of the past few lines replaying like a tape deck and then replaying "You desire a lesson in time travel? Very well.">

VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Pissed00=I will bring unity to the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Pissed01=We shall forge a new peace.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Pissed02=I might be Hierarch, yes, but that does not mean I enjoy speaking at great length.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Pissed03=You are quite insistent, aren't you? Perhaps you are part Tal'darim...
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Pissed04=<threatening> When I was a Templar, I could solve problems with a psi-blade, if you take my meaning.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Pissed05=Adun, Tassadar, Zeratul... All of my mentors met an early end. Perhaps the cost of greatness is too high?
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Pissed06=Have you ever said my name backwards? There is a strange music to it...
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/Ready00=We must stand as one.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/What00=Dawn will come.

VoiceOver/Ascendant/Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Help00=You dare to challenge me?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed00=We are bound by the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed01=But through Rak'shir we find ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed02=My thoughts are guided by the terrazine mists. Amon knows we are coming, he knows we shall claim our vengeance.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed03=You are simply unaware of the gifts granted to us through the breath of creation... the unseen truths it brings to light...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed04=Shakuras has fallen... Aiur has fallen... Does that mean all of these structures were constructed aboard the Spear of Adun?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed05=If an immortal dies, does that mean it was never an immortal to begin with?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed06=What if our entire universe was just a game being played by beings of incredible power?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed07=And then there were beings watching those beings play their games instead of actually playing the games themselves.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed08=Ow. I'm twitching... Perhaps I should limit my terrazine intake... for a while.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Ready00=Vengeance for the betrayed.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/What00=Ask. I may listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/What01=Action is the only course.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/What02=May the terrazine flow...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/What03=The talons of Slayn listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/What04=Remember your place.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/What05=Alakor nir shazak.

VoiceOver/Avenger/Pissed00=I serve the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/Avenger/Pissed01=Our fate lies with our homeland. 
VoiceOver/Avenger/Pissed02=Many of our people have fallen... but their deaths will not be in vain.
VoiceOver/Avenger/Pissed03=The enemy has changed, and so must we.
VoiceOver/Avenger/Pissed04=I imagine that Adun never thought he'd see someone like me.
VoiceOver/Avenger/Pissed05=What do you call an Aiur protoss who can meld with the shadows? Hm... Overpowered!
VoiceOver/Avenger/Pissed06=I am but ONE avenger. Please do not refer to us in the plural form. 
VoiceOver/Avenger/Ready00=Vengeance for Aiur.
VoiceOver/Avenger/What00=We will atone.
VoiceOver/Avenger/What01=There is no solace in exile.
VoiceOver/Avenger/What02=Give your order.

VoiceOver/Corsair/Attack03=By the grace of Aiur!
VoiceOver/Corsair/Attack04=Zhakul guilda!
VoiceOver/Corsair/Attack05=They shall be disrupted...
VoiceOver/Corsair/Attack06=I fight to the end.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Help00=The battle begins!
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed00=These skies are mine.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed01=Look at all the pretty lights!
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed02=I wonder what this button does.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed03=I think this was a big mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed04=You might even say... a huge mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed05=If only I hadn't fallen asleep during my break lessons.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed06=I must stop staring at the sun.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed07=Corners like it's on rails.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed08=I feel the need... the need for... an ejector seat! Look out!
VoiceOver/Corsair/Ready00=It is a good day to die.

VoiceOver/DarkArchon/Pissed02=Once you go Dark Archon... you never come back...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/Pissed03=Do not tempt us... Your mind is not as strong as you think.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/Pissed04=Ulreazj lives on... We feel his rage.

VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed01=What is it you seek, my friend?
VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed02=It is in the forge of combat that I feel closest to Fenix's memories. I can see clearly through his eyes.
VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed03=As he tore through his enemies, Fenix would repeat to himself a code he lived by. That reminded him why he fought.

VoiceOver/Fenix/Yes04=Your will made manifest.
VoiceOver/Fenix/Yes05=None shall impede me.
VoiceOver/Fenix/Yes06=Honor guide me!
VoiceOver/Fenix/Yes07=Without hesitation.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Attack00=Suffer as we have.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Attack01=Our power is from within.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Attack02=Duty is my shield!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Attack03=Rahlga s'ak-ash! (Translation: Duty is my shield!)
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Attack04=For Aiur!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Attack05=We will overcome.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Attack06=Together, we vanquish.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Help00=Our foe strikes!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed00=With the Khala fallen to corruption, the memories of our ancestors are lost to us.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed01=For the first time, the halls of the Templar Archives are silent.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed02=It has been difficult to bear.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed03=Without the Khala to rely on our power has proven difficult to control, but not impossible. 
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed04=Your thoughts are growing harder to read... It seems my strength has not fully returned.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed05=Let me try something... You are feeling... happy. No, sad. No, wait, happy. <frustrated exertion> How do the dark templar deal with this?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed06=(sigh) I do not even know how I feel any more...
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed07=I am sorry, our situation is difficult... I lack even the will to make lightning puns... Shocking, I know. Oh, I did it!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed09=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed_Alt09=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Ready00=Khassar de templari! (Translation: From order comes justice!)
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What00=My charge?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What01=We shall endure.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What02=Your thoughts are clear.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What03=Our power shall serve.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What04=The darkness will be repelled.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What05=Wisdom through adversity.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What06=We are focused once more.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/What07=Our spirit is indomitable.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes00=En taro Tassadar! (Translation: In honor of Tassadar!)
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes01=I heed the call.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes02=As ever, I serve.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes03=I will comply.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes04=O lok-natal. (Translation: I will comply.)
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes05=Unity through purpose.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes06=We continue on.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Yes07=For Artanis.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed00=My memory is not what it was....
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed01=These steel limbs are not my own.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed02=I have known only an eternity of war.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed03=My resolve is unending.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed04=There can be only one.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed05=Back in my day I had to teleport to and from school in the snow. Uphill both dimensions.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed06=Youth is wasted on the young.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed07=Where is my walker...? Oh, I'm in it.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed08=The second thing to go is your memory. I can't remember what the first thing is.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes00=It is destined.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes01=Ik s'abeel. (Translation: It is destined.)
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes02=There shall be a reckoning.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes03=Por zalah!
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes04=Our cannons shall sing.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes05=We march to victory!
VoiceOver/Instigator/Attack00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Instigator/Attack01=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Instigator/Attack02=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Instigator/Attack03=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Instigator/Attack04=What's my line again?

VoiceOver/Instigator/What03=What's my line again?

VoiceOver/Instigator/What05=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Instigator/What06=What's my line again?

VoiceOver/Instigator/Yes04=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Instigator/Yes05=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Instigator/Yes06=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack00=Strike now!
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack01=The opportune moment has come.
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack02=Together, we cannot be matched.
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack03=We cannot fail now.
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack04=Witness the power of a phase-smith!
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack05=Templari paru! (Translation: Justice awaits!)
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack06=E-sa ahtu! (Translation: Foes beware!)
VoiceOver/Karax/Attack07=Foes beware!
VoiceOver/Karax/Death00=I die... a Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/Help00=I am engaging our foe.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed00=The task ahead of us is difficult, but worthwhile.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed01=I see the grand design behind it all. The intricate machinery of the universe and everything within it.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed02=These psionic storms are growing worse. Destroying this power structure will likely cause a catastrophic failure.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed03=It's a shame the Spear of Adun must engage Amon's zerg brood. Its aid would make our task a great deal simpler.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed04=I hope my drones are doing alright up there...
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed05=It has only been a short while since we returned to Aiur and had to flee from it. Yet it seems like a lifetime ago.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed06=The Khalai long served the firstborn. We were the great builders, the dreamers of dreams and now we are all equal.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed07=I am a phase-smith and I am a Templar... Fenix was right, it is indeed a glorious day.
VoiceOver/Karax/Ready00=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/Karax/What00=Yes, Hierarch? 
VoiceOver/Karax/What01=My expertise is yours.
VoiceOver/Karax/What02=What may I resolve? 
VoiceOver/Karax/What03=I will find the solution.
VoiceOver/Karax/What04=I hear you.
VoiceOver/Karax/What05=We are all Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/What06=Amon shall not prevail.
VoiceOver/Karax/What07=Na ku a'fal Aiur. (Translation: We shall avenge Aiur!)
VoiceOver/Karax/What08=A phase-smith is always prepared.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes00=It will be.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes01=I concur.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes02=We are united.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes03=The psi-matrix will fall.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes04=Progress is made by the bold.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes05=Shan-ala-ari Daelaam.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes06=Purpose guides us.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes07=Aiur will be restored.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack00=My power is vast.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack01=You will not decide our fate!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack02=Be gone.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack03=Your time has ended.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack04=I am unstoppable.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack05=I sense their fear...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack06=All shall be one with the light!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Death00=This was not to be...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Help00=I strike at the enemy!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed00=So long as Amon lives, we are all in peril.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed01=I will bring peace to the cosmos.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed02=So many universes came before us, all of them turns in the Infinite Cycle...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed03=I am the culmination of prophecy.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed04=I can see everything now... 
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed05=...the thread of my life interwoven with the threads of many others'.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed06=Alone, we were fragile. But together, we formed a bond that cannot break.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed07=That bond must sustain us now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Ready00=I am infinite.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What00=What is it you require?
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What01=Speak to me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What02=My destiny manifests.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What03=Infinity unravels before me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What04=A new age will dawn.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What05=Amon shall meet his end.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What06=I can see... countless universes.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes00=The final stand begins now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes01=I am called.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes02=I cannot delay.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes03=This is my burden to bear.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes04=I will not fail.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes05=It shall be.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack00=You're in my way...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack01=No mercy.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack02=Death awaits you!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack03=I sense your fear.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack04=Slay them all!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack05=This is what you deserve.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack06=Whatever it takes.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Death00=This isn't over...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Help00=The fight begins.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed00=My true enemy waits in the darkness.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed01=Amon and his hybrid will die.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed02=This is the true war--the one that could end everything.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed03=I hope your gods have an awfully good explanation for why I ended up here with you, Artanis. 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed04=Are you trying to annoy me?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed05=Well, here's a hint for you... It's working.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed06=I quit infesting terrans, but you're starting to make me reconsider that.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed07=I bet Abathur could mutate you into something real special.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed08=So much has happened. Sometimes the past seven years really feel more like seventeen years... 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Ready00=I will not be stopped.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What00=What is it, already?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What01=Speak.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What02=Yes?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What03=Your queen listens.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What04=You have my attention.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What05=Explain yourself.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What06=Make it quick.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes00=I am the Swarm.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes01=Boldly.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes02=No time like the present.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes03=My search continues...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes04=I've come this far.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes05=I need answers.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack00=Initiating purification.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack01=They shall be cleansed.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack02=Sanitizing.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack03=Righteous fury burns brightest.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack04=Priming weapon systems.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack05=Rono hashik. (Translation: Directive confirmed.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack06=Eliminating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Help00=Target in range.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed00=The Purifiers heed your call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed01=Honor our sacrifice.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed02=We have chosen the path of duty. We ask only for the respect we are owed.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed03=I pledged my life to the Templar... What have you done?
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed04=Ask not what your robotic warrior can do for you, but what you can do for your robotic warrior.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed05=What can you do for me? Well... I would like some weapons upgrades.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed06=And... perhaps some high capacity power fluctuators...
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed07=Hm, that new trillic compression mesh looks very imposing, does it not?
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed08=And would a fresh coat of paint be too much to add? It has been millennia, after all.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed09=It takes a lot of work to look this good after thousands of years.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Ready00=I return to the skies.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What00=I soar again.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What01=I answer the call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What02=All systems ready.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What03=Activating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What04=Too long have I rested.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What05=My will is my own.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What06=War has no end.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes00=Assigning navigation.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes01=Lokh-tai. (Translation: Immediately.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes02=Calibrating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes03=Order received.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes04=O verash. (Translation: I understand.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes05=Complying.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes06=Taking flight.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack00=Ascension through battle!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack01=They shall flee before me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack02=For the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack03=They shall die most painfully.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack04=My triumph awaits.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack05=No one stands against me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack06=Vok'az Shirol!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Help00=Commencing bloodshed.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed00=Weakness is a path to death.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed01=The Templar have words... The Tal'darim have blades!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed02=Before we became the Chosen, we were the Forged. And we can never be broken.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed03=We do not waste time with engineering and manufacture. The weak provide our weapons and our ships.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed04=Piloting a ship is no more complicated than wielding a blade. I know what every panel in this vessel does! Except... this one.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed05=<Button pressing sound effect> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed06=<Beeping sound effect> No! Cease that infernal noise! Do not make me turn this ship around!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed07=<Beeping sound effect continues> Argh! Be silent! <Smashing sound, then all is quiet>
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed08=There. Now for you... I may not be your real mothership, but you still have to obey me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Ready00=Victory has come.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What00=You presume to speak?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What01=Impress me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What02=This had better be worthwhile.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What03=I will not suffer fools.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What04=Fealty unto the Highlord.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What05=We are the soul of strength.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What06=My will is iron.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes00=A fine scheme.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes01=We are in agreement... this time.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes02=So long as it leads to glory.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes03=By our birthright.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes04=I shall indulge.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes05=A worthy order.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes06=Rik'kan thok ishar.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Help00=Engaging the enemy!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed00=I long for the skies of Aiur!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed01=Our fury shall be unleashed.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed02=We shall rise from the ashes!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed03=Valor is my shield!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed04=I used to have a lot of nerve... cords.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed05=Transmute!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed06=Second star on the right, straight on 'til morning.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed07=We push ourselves to the end. And when we reach it, we push farther. (Beat) So I guess that's not really "the end", is it?
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed08=Justice for all!... Except the zerg.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack00=My blade thirsts.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack01=Death is a gift.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack02=They will be purged.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack03=The culling begins.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack04=Executing.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack05=Nothing will remain...
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Death00=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Death01=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Death02=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Help00=I shall relish this battle!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed00=I stalk the weak.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed01=You have disappointments... I have solutions.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed02=Only warriors deserve the honor of fair combat. I eliminate the rest.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed03=They are always too foolish to sense my presence... until it's too late.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed04=The frail must die so the strong can thrive. Such is the way of Rak'Shir--such is the way of the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed05=You may find our ways harsh, templar. But it is better to be harsh than pathetic.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed06=Does your Hierarch listen to you? Because I don't.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Ready00=I seek the unworthy.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What00=Ah, the scent of fear.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What01=I sense...weakness. Frailty.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What02=Where does my prey hide?
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What03=My search goes on.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What04=I yearn for slaughter.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What05=Blood will be spilled.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes00=If you are certain.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes01=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes02=With pleasure.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes03=Yes?
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes04=Viras Rakan!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes05=Skosal vin'shir.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes06=I hunt.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes07=It shall be so.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack00=Let their blood be spilled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack01=Death has come for you.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack02=This is why I live.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack03=The slaughter begins.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack04=I will enjoy this.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack05=Your reckoning is at hand.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack06=Be afraid.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack07=Nowhere to run.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack_NP00=For the Swarm.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack_NP01=I obey.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death00=I do not... fear death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death01=I see... the Void...
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death_NP00=Service... Complete.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Help00=The enemy seeks my death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed00=The disgraced are forced to become Vanguards. The truly loyal choose to become Slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed01=Wherever you go... there I am.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed02=Don't blink.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed03=The Nerazim's stalkers are pathetic. They should move on with their lives.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed04=Don't worry if you find me hard to hit. It's just a phase.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed05=Before you see the Void... you must DIE.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed06=In every generation, there are the chosen ones. Together, they will stand against the enemies of the Tal'darim. They are the slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Ready00=Fear the shadows.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Ready_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What00=Death awaits.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What01=I am the Highlord's weapon.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What02=Our enemies shall suffer.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What03=I have made my choice.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What04=Set me loose upon our foes.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What05=The weak will be culled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes00=I move unseen.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes01=As Alarak commands.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes02=Deadly.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes03=I pursue.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes04=Hunt and kill.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes05=None can hide.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes06=Of course.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes07=I sense their fear.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack00=Death comes to all.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack01=Dum adu'nala. (Translation: Death comes to all.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack02=The Void hungers....
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack03=Cold fury.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack04=Antu kahl. (Translation: Cold fury.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack05=Forever sleep.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack06=Complete the cycle.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack07=For Shakuras!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Death00=Finally...
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Help00=Let our enemy know our fury!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Help_Alt00=Fall back to the shadows!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed00=My heart is colder than these steel limbs.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed01=Twilight comes as it must.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed02=We are all but shadows in the Void.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed03=I hear the call of the stars.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed04=Night falls. And so will you.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed05=I am one with the darkness... (Crashing sound) Ouch! That hurt.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed06=You look better in the dark.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed07=Don't blink.... Or you''ll miss me.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed08=Now you see me... now you don't. Oh, wait... here I am. 
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed09=You went to bed early last night.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed10=I see you turned off your phone.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed11=You never return my calls.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed12=I'm your biggest fan.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed13=Restraining order? What about our love?
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed14=I have pictures of you. Hundreds.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/What00=Cold is the Void.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/What01=I am the heart of darkness.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/What02=You require my skills?
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/What03=I am the voice of the eclipse.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/What04=State thy bidding. 
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/What05=We are one with the shadows.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes00=Very well.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes01=It shall be as you say.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes02=Intriguing.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes03=Veraku. (Translation: Intriguing.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes04=I serve... for now.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes05=We move unseen.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes06=For the reckoning.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Yes07=Very wise. 
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Attack00=I protect.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Attack01=Guarding.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Attack02=Sacred land...
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Attack03=Aiur's foes burn.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Attack04=For the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Attack05=None withstand...
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Attack06=As one!
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Help00=Embracing battle!
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Pissed00=I am called.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Pissed01=Protect... Aiur.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Pissed02=I see all.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Pissed03=For... homeland.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Pissed04=Never rest.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Pissed05=Blades ready.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Pissed06=Unending duty...
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/Ready00=For Aiur.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/What00=I wait.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/What01=Dura shi s'al. (Translation: My rest is over.)

VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed00=There is still valor to be won among the stars.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed01=The Purifiers will retake their rightful place among the Templar.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed02=Your Hierarch is unlike the Judicators we have known. He is a bright spark in a series of shadows.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed03=We protoss have many ways of surviving the brutalities of battle. But only the way of the Purifiers ensures eternal life.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed04=I do wish I had considered the Conclave's preconceived notions about robotic intelligence before joining the Purifier program.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed05=Communication matrices nearing maximum capacity. Recalibrating memory web.

VoiceOver/Vanguard/Death01=I am but memory.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Help00=The fires of conflict burn bright.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed00=Even broken links can be made to serve the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed01=I am the last link in the chain of ascension. I am a Vanguard, and only my death shall have meaning.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed02=Forgiveness is a Templar virtue. I seek only for my failures to be forgotten.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed03=We are the first to battle, and if fate smiles upon us, we shall never return.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed04=You Templar refer to your assault striders as "Immortals". Our cultures are quite different, indeed.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed05=To think of the trouble the Tal'darim have caused the Templar. Be thankful you never encountered the Venti'darim.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed06=I tire, and my thoughts darken. Leave me to them.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Ready00=The hour is upon us.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/What00=We are reforged.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/What01=I will serve.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/What02=Unto death.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/What03=Ever atoning.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/What04=Sko'rishar vinok.

VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/Pissed01=United in purpose, we serve the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/Pissed02=Conflict must not be seen through the lens of desperation.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/Pissed03=Infinity burns around us.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/Pissed04=There is no greater void than the one between your ears.

VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed00=Together, we shall ensure the future of our people.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed01=Our blades burn brightest in dark times.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed02=This is the greatest battle we could ever hope to win.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed03=I am Matriarch of the Nerazim. We have sheltered our brethren from Aiur, yet our differences persist.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed04=I do not wish to speak ill of the Templar... But let us be honest. Most of you could not complete the Shadow Walk.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed05=Not that we wouldn't enjoy watching you try.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed06=But... that is a matter for times of peace. For now, we are at war.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Ready00=The Nerazim will answer.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/What00=Yes?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/What01=What is your will?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/What02=I walk the shadowed path.

VoiceOver/Vorazun/Yes04=It is my honor.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Yes05=There is much to be done.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Attack00=Blades of justice!
VoiceOver/Zealot/Attack01=It must be done.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Attack02=None shall stand!
VoiceOver/Zealot/Attack03=Aruu nal adan!

VoiceOver/Zealot/Death00=For Aiur...
VoiceOver/Zealot/Help00=We embrace the glory of battle!
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed00=I am Templar. I am the sword of truth.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed01=Combat is the anvil of will.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed02=Our enemies must be eradicated.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed03=Victory is the only truth that matters.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed04=Fear is for the enemy. 
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed05=Do not make me count to zmidlarj.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed06=It is said that ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed07=How peaceful it must be for you, to have a mind unburdened by thought.

VoiceOver/Zealot/Yes04=Khassar de templari!
VoiceOver/Zealot/Yes05=For Artanis!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack00=Vengeance is at hand.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack01=Blood for blood.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack02=My death awaits.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack03=Ascension for the fallen.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack04=Remember me.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack05=I will not die alone.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack06=My purpose is fulfilled.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack_NP00=For the Swarm.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Attack_NP01=I obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Death00=Victory through death.

VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Death_NP00=Service... Complete.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Help00=We strike at the Highlord's foes.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed00=I will be of use, dead or alive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed01=If Alarak wishes my death, he need only ask.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed02=It is a thankless job, but someone has to do it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed03=All supplicants must die. All supplicants must serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed04=Ah, the Breath of Creation. More like the Breath of Recreation, am I right?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed05=There was once a Supplicant who stood head and shoulders above the rest of us. He was a Tall-darim.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed06=Okay, maybe I deserve to die for that one.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed07=A few of the other supplicants and I have a bet going over which of us dies first. We call it... the "dead league." We're still working on the name.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed08=Witness me!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Ready00=My life for the Highlord.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Ready_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What00=I will adhere to the chain.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What01=Awaiting your decree.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What02=Eternal obedience.

VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What04=Loyalty unto death.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What05=I am a servant of Slayn.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What06=Oblivion beckons.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes00=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes01=I live to serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes02=My fate is in your hands.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes03=For Alarak.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes04=I hear and obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes05=Without remorse.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack00=The shadow descends.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack01=Break before us!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack02=Your end has come.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack03=Zerashk gulida!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack04=Face the endless Void!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack05=May our blades strike true.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack06=As fate decrees.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death00=Void embrace me.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death01=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death02=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death03=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death04=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Help00=Our blades meet the enemy.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed00=I am Shadow Guard. I am the shield of twilight.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed01=Our duty is bound to the Matriarch's will.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed02=We are the nameless guardians of the Nerazim.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed03=Each legion of Shadow Guard consists of exactly one hundred Centurions. Never more, never less. Unless one falls in battle, and then we replace them... quickly.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed04=What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? I shall tell you once I meet an unstoppable force.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed05=Not all Nerazim can merge themselves with the shadows. Some of us merely bend it to our will, from time to time.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed06=We fashion armor from the bones of our prey. It is a grand tradition reminding us of how far we have come... No. We do not have "jaw envy."
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed07=The Templar zealots won't admit it, but our shadow charge is stunning.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Ready00=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What00=The Shadow Guard waits.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What01=Give us your command.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What02=We stand watch.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What03=Na adan sai'osh.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What04=Ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What05=We await our charge.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What06=None shall break us.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes00=So be it.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes01=Your command is law.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes02=For Vorazun!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes03=The guard moves.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes04=We shall shield this world.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes05=Eternally resolute.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack00=Executing.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack01=As the Hierarch wills.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack02=Know the might of the Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack03=We are the overwhelming tide.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack04=Your purification is at hand!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack05=To glorious battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack06=Be undone!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Death00=Releasing consciousness.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Help00=We meet the enemy in battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed00=I am a Sentinel. I am undying. I am pure.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed01=Glacius may have fallen, but we, its children, live on.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed02=We are the first. The Purifiers, reborn.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed03=It is treatment like this that caused the first generation of Purifiers to rebel against their creators. Do you really wish to test me?
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed04=Test complete. All systems are working perfectly.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed05=Calling me a robotic zealot demeans both me and my people. We prefer mechanical Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed06=When I get knocked down, I get up again. No one will ever keep me down.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed07=A purifier's purity ring represents their commitment to stay pure and to burn anything to death that would attempt to compromise that commitment.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Ready00=This warrior awakens.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What00=Listening.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What01=Guide my blade.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What02=The enemy shall be purified.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What03=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What04=Speak your demands.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What05=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What06=Identify our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes00=Ul'as addari.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes01=Protocols aligned.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes02=With honor.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes03=My blade yearns to meet our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes04=For Fenix!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes05=Khassar de templari!
VoiceOver/ZealotShakuras/Ready00=My life for Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/Help00=We embrace the glory of battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What02=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What05=We stand unified.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What06=Na adan Daelaam.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt02=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt05=We stand as one.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt06=Na adan atum.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack00=There is much to answer for.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack01=The scales will be balanced.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack02=Aruu nal adan!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack03=Oblivion descends!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack04=We must act!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Death00=The Void... beckons.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Help00=My enemies close in!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Help01=I face a new trial.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed00=I stand at the threshold of destiny.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed01=Only the truth can lead us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed02=The xel'naga have given us the keys to our future.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed03=We must be ever watching... ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed04=I suspect vigilance is one of your... weaker attributes.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed05=Kindly leave me to my meditation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed06=How am I to avert disaster with your constant meddling?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed07=I see. This is but another test.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Ready00=I will find hope for our people.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What00=I seek the path of salvation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What01=My burdens weigh heavily.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What02=You address me?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What03=I bring wisdom in times of chaos.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What04=S'shozak mok nul.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes00=I shall find a way.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes01=Glory to the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes02=Honor commands.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes03=En aru'din Raszagal.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes04=We must not hesitate.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes05=The prophecy guides us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes06=My allegiance is yours.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes07=I will fulfill my calling.
