Conversation/AICommunication/Line00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00044=We must retreat!

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00069=Leave nothing behind!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00078=So the protoss wish to do battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00085=We've encountered the enemy!

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00146=These zerg need to be reminded who their queen is.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00148=This building is terran in origin.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00168=We're pulling back.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00249=Vanquish the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00250=We cannot hold! We must return to base!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00251=The enemy is too strong. We are regrouping.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00252=They are too powerful! I am pulling back my troops.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00253=Let our enemies feel the might of the khala!

Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00032=You will not have the ability to train additional combat units.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00033=In order to succeed, you will need to use your SCVs to repair your structures and to fight back against the aggressors.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00034=En Taro Tassadar, student. In this simulation, you will learn to control large forces more efficiently.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00035=Begin by organizing your forces into control groups. Examine the units available to you and distribute them into powerful attack groups.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00036=As you can see, you have units stationed throughout the simulation area. These are in stasis until you are ready to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00037=Round 1
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00038=Welcome back, Commander. A strong economy is key to victory, and the key to a strong economy is efficient resource gathering.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00039=In this exercise your base management skills will be challenged. Begin by collecting sufficient resources to expand to the extra resource area nearby. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00040=By building a second command center at the expansion site, you will effectively double the amount of resources you receive.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00041=Complete the exercise by training a force before the time runs out.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00042=Good morning, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to survive through several waves of attackers.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00043=Each wave will be challenging to overcome with the forces available. Directly controlling the actions of your units will give you the edge you need to prevail.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00044=Press the ready button when you wish to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00045=Welcome, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum possible damage using only the siege tanks and medivac dropships allocated.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00046=You will have a limited amount of time to destroy as much of the enemy base as possible. Scouting the base with your medivacs before making your assault is advised.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00047=Enemy forces cannot be harmed until you press the ready button, so conduct your scouting carefully.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00048=Once you are ready, strike swiftly! Destroy as many enemies as possible before time runs out!

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00001=For nearly 300 years, humans thought they were alone in Koprulu sector.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00002=The zerg emerged, seeking to consume all in their path.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00003=And before long, the protoss, a highly advanced alien race, began wiping out infested worlds, burning zerg and terran alike. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00004=A three-way war... unlike anything humanity had ever faced...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00005=All the while... a human civil war raged.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00006=Marshal Jim Raynor vowed to oppose the corrupt dictator Arcturus Mengsk for the betrayal of the woman he loved... Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00007=Uh, boys? How about that evac?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00008=Damn you, Arcturus! Don't do this.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00009=It's done. Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit. Now!
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00010=Kerrigan, a loyal operative, was left to die at the hands of the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00011=But the zerg had other plans.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00012=They transformed her... and unleashed her psionic power upon the Koprulu Sector...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00013=...searching for their real objective...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00014=The protoss were unaware of this danger... and slow to respond.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00015=Their rulers, the Conclave, had dispatched Executor Artanis to hunt for Tassadar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00016=...a commander who had refused to wipe out infested terran worlds.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00017=They crossed paths with a dark templar mystic, whose kind was considered heretics by the Conclave.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00018=Through great effort, Zeratul convinced Tassadar and Artanis that he was not their enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00019=Together they rallied more protoss from both factions against the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00020=Despite the Conclave's fury, they achieved significant victories against the Swarm.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00021=But when Zeratul struck down one of the Overmind's Cerebrates...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00022=From his thoughts, the Overmind gleaned Aiur's true location...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00023=...and the Swarm descended upon the protoss homeworld...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00024=It was Tassadar who kept the templar from extinction that day.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00025=Using the power of both the templar and the dark templar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00026=Aiur was lost
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00027=Old prejudices were set aside.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00028=Without the Overmind, the swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00029=Kerrigan sought control of all the zerg...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00030=Once her rule was uncontested...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00031=The zerg stood unchallenged, but to the relief of all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00032=Zeratul suspected the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00033=He uncovered prophecies stating that an ancient entity, Amon...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00034=And that this evil might already have control...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00035=It was during this time that Executor Artanis, hailed as a hero...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00036=As Hierarch, Artanis united both factions...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00037=But such unity is only a dream for Jim Raynor.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00038=Mengsk still rules, and Raynor's small rebellion has counted for nothing against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00039=Perhaps... it is time for a new strategy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00040=Raynor had vowed to see Kerrigan dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00041=Even his rebellion against Mengsk's tyranny...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00042=But with the arrival of old friends, and mysterious new allies...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00043=...scoring major victories on multiple fronts.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00044=But Zeratul warned him about the encroaching darkness...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00045=...was the Queen of Blades. She was needed alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00046=In a daring raid on the zerg homeworld of Char...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00047=...used an ancient xel'naga artifact to neutralize Kerrigan's power...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00048=The Queen of Blades was helpless.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00049=Jim?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00050=It's okay. I gotcha.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00051=Without a leader, the Swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00052=Raynor and Kerrigan found sanctuary with Valerian Mengsk...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00053=Valerian Mengsk offered them sanctuary... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00054=During the raid, Kerrigan and Raynor were separated. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00055=...He was briefly interrogated, and summarily executed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00056=Kerrigan sought vengeance.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00057=With Zeratul's guidance, Kerrigan gathered the zerg broods...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00058=The killing will never stop until Mengsk is dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00059=Kerrigan began dismantling the Dominion's military...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00060=To her surprise... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00061=She charted a course to Korhal, Mengsk's stronghold. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00062=But there was little time to celebrate.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00063=Raynor and Valerian Mengsk set about reforming the Dominion... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00064=With the zerg and terrans quelled...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00065=He declared that the unified protoss...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00066=Any dissenting voices went unheard amid the hope for reclamation.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00067=Zeratul set off alone, searching for the truth...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00068=They were wrong.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00069=...erupted almost overnight.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00070=The protoss homeworld of Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00071=...with all their might and fury.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00072=...but Artanis led the survivors to the dark templar's homeworld of Shakuras.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00073=The templar were now in the dark templar's debt.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00074=...even enlisting the aid of old friends and enemies like Raynor, Mengsk, and Zeratul.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00075=The Queen of Blades betrayed them all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00076=Billions of humans and protoss were killed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00077=He sacrificed himself to kill the Overmind.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00078=...his own mind was left vulnerable.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00079=The war seemed to end there.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00080=...was attempting to merge protoss and zerg life forms into an unholy hybrid.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00081=...of Kerrigan and her power.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00082=...was made leader of both the templar and the dark templar.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00083=...and promised to one day reclaim the glory they had lost on Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00084=But his retaliatory strike failed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00085=...proved ineffective against the Dominion's propaganda machine.

Conversation/Tutorial/Line00001=In StarCraft II you view the battle from above as the commander of an army. You use your mouse to control your view of the battlefield and give instructions to the units under your command.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00002=In the lower left of your screen is a minimap that allows you to see what is happening all over the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00003=In the lower right of your screen you can find the command card. The command card is used to issue orders to selected units.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00004=The lower middle of your screen is the unit information panel. This shows information about the units or structures you have selected.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00005=Above the command card is the "Tip" button. The "Tip" button appears when there is new information for your perusal. Simply click the "Tip" button to read the tip.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00006=To change your view, move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen. When your mouse touches the edge of the screen, your view will slide in that direction.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00007=You can also use the minimap to shift your view to any part of the battlefield. Simply left-click on the minimap to jump to a new location.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00008=Now that you have a unit selected, right-click on the ground to order the unit to move somewhere.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00009=To move a unit you must first select it. Use your mouse and left-click on the unit to select it.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00010=Well done commander.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00011=To attack an enemy, select your units and right-click on the enemy.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00012=During the attack, you can mouse over the enemy to see a bar representing their life. A unit is destroyed when its hit-points reach zero. You can also mouse over your own units to keep an eye on their life bars.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00013=You can also use the attack move command to tell your units to move to a location and attack any enemy forces they encounter along the way.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00014=To make an attack-move command, left-click on the attack button from the command card while your units are selected, and then left-click on the ground where you want your units to go.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00015=To create a new terran structure, first select an SCV by left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00016=Now left-click the "Build Structure" button in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00017=Left-click on the structure you want to build and then left-click anywhere on the ground to order the SCV to place the new structure. The SCV will move to your chosen location, and build the structure there.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00018=The Command Center cannot be constructed too close to minerals. When placing the Command Center look for the overlay to be completely green before left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00019=SCVs are your primary means of collecting resources. While your SCV is selected, right-click a mineral field to begin collecting resources.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00020=Your SCV will start harvesting minerals and dropping them off at the closest Command Center.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00021=You can train more SCVs from the Command Center to gather minerals faster.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00022=Your SCV will continue harvesting until you order it to do something else.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00023=Well done commander. Harvesting minerals is central to any terran strategy.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00024=To create new units, you must first select a structure that trains units. Select a Barracks to see what units you can train from it. Those units will appear in the command card in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00025=Left-click on the "Marine" button in the command card to order the Barracks to begin training that unit. Once the unit is complete, it will appear next to the Barracks.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00026=You can queue multiple units at the same time. Simply click on the button again to add another Marine to the queue.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00027=Before you can train a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit. If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to train that unit.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00028=To increase the maximum number of units available, you must build supply depots. To do this, select an SCV and left-click the Build Structures button. Left-click on Build Supply Depot and left-click anywhere to place the Supply Depot.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00029=Your current supply maximum is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen along with how much supply you are currently using.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00030=The Zerg are a savage alien race made up of a host of different species that all mutate from a single creature type called a Larva.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00031=The Zerg create a thick layer of bio-matter called creep under all of their bases and use creatures called Overlords to provide supply for their armies.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00032=Many Zerg creatures can morph from one form to another on the battlefield. Zerg structures can also mutate from one form to another, growing more powerful and unlocking new unit types as they do.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00033=The Drone is consumed when the structure is created, so you will need another Drone to build another structure.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00034=Creep is an organic growth that spreads around any Zerg base. Most Zerg units will move more quickly when they're on creep, and all Zerg structures except Hatcheries must be built on it. Structures that are no longer on creep will slowly die.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00035=Creep is generated by Hatcheries, Queens, and Overlords, so you can use these units and structures to expand your creep.   
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00036=To mutate a Zerg structure, first select a Drone. On the command card left-click the Basic Mutation button and left-click again to choose a Hatchery. Then left-click to place the Hatchery.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00037=The Hatchery cannot be placed too close to minerals. When trying to place the Hatchery look for the structure overlay to be completely green before placing.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00038=Zerg units are created from Larva. To create a Zerg Drone, left-click on a Hatchery and then left-click on the select larva button on the command card.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00039=With a larva selected you can left-click on the Morph to Drone button in the command card to order the larva to morph into a Drone.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00040=Each Hatchery generates additional larva over time.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00041=To create a Protoss structure, select a probe and left-click on the Build Structures button on the command card. Then left-click Warp in Nexus and left-click the ground to create that structure.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00042=The Nexus cannot be placed too close to minerals. When trying to place the Nexus look for the structure overlay to be completely green before placing.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00043=Before you can warp in a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit. If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to warp in that unit.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00044=The Protoss are an ancient alien race that employ advanced technologies and powerful psionics to defeat their enemies.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00045=Protoss have shields on their units and structures to protect them from enemy attacks. Shield strength is represented by a blue bar above the hit-point bar.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00046=Shields are reduced by enemy attacks in the same manner as hit-points, however shields regenerate quickly after combat has finished. 
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00047=Xel'Naga Watch Towers can be controlled by any player. Place a unit near the Watch Tower to activate it and reveal a large area of the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00048=If several players have units near a Watch Tower then the tower is not controlled and no player can activate it.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00049=Some obstacles can be destroyed by weapons fire, and you can attack obstacles to clear a path for your troops.  
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00050=Some features like shrubs and smoke will block your vision. Your units can move through these features freely but only flying units can see past them.
