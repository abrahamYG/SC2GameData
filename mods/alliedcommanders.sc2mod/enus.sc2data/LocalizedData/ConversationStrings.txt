Conversation/acObj/Line00747=Looks like Moebius Corps sent a damn Archangel after us. Oughta bust that thing up before it causes too much trouble.
Conversation/acObj/Line00748=Hah! Just goes to show, no piece of hardware is half as good as the pilot inside it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00749=Are you kiddin' me? Damn thing turned tail and ran. What a waste!
Conversation/acObj/Line00750=Scouts are tellin' me only two groups of thrashers are left. Just gotta hold out a little longer.
Conversation/acObj/Line00751=This is it, people! Last group of thrashers. Let's finish this!
Conversation/acObj/Line00752=The fortress is gettin' torn up real bad. Better take out some Void thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line00753=The fortress has taken heavy damage. We better start killing Void thrashers like it's going outta style.
Conversation/acObj/Line00754=The fortress's going critical. We gotta end this assault now!
Conversation/acObj/Line00755=The fortress is under some pretty heavy fire. We gotta take these Void thrashers down pronto.
Conversation/acObj/Line00756=Fortress is under fire. If anyone wants to go and kill a Void thrasher, I'd be much obliged.
Conversation/acObj/Line00757=Taking some serious heat here. Void thrasher's ain't letting up!
Conversation/acObj/Line00759=Some solid work there. Sensors show only three Void thrashers left.
Conversation/acObj/Line00760=Down to two Void thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line00761=That's it, one last Void thrasher. Send that thing to hell.
Conversation/acObj/Line00762=Hell yeah, we made it. Tell you what, next time y'all are in town I'm buying the first round. And that's a promise. Haha!
Conversation/acObj/Line00768=Thank goodness you're here. Our research team has discovered that Amon is moving his troops across the sector via warp conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00769=The conduits cannot be destroyed, but the shuttles can. They must be stopped before they reach the warp conduits and escape!
Conversation/acObj/Line00770=Amon has activated the central warp conduit. Be prepared to prevent the shuttles from escaping.
Conversation/acObj/Line00771=Multiple shuttle launches bearing for the central warp conduit. Destroying them is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line00772=The shuttles have been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00773=Focus on the shuttles! They've initiated warp protocol!
Conversation/acObj/Line00774=Scans confirm the shuttles' destruction.
Conversation/acObj/Line00777=One of the warp conduits is active again. Several waves of shuttles are converging on it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00778=The xel'naga shrines nearby are reacting to Amon's armies. Researching them may provide useful intel, but we will need an escort.
Conversation/acObj/Line00779=Dear god... The transport has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00780=Our research vessel is ready. We're moving out now.
Conversation/acObj/Line00781=Scan complete. Thank you for your help! They would have been lost without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line00782=We've lost contact with the research team.... They're gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line00783=No! The transport vessel... has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00784=We've gathered the data we need. Thank you for the escort, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00785=Our scans are finished. Science owes you a great debt, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00786=Research vessel ready. Let's get a team to that shrine.
Conversation/acObj/Line00787=Preparing a research vessel. Let's make this one count.
Conversation/acObj/Line00788=Void thrashers are starting to burn a hole through the fortress's ceiling. So, you know, that seems bad.
Conversation/acObj/Line00789=Hey! The fortress is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line00790=The shuttles will soon escape, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line00791=The shuttles have reached the conduit. They will soon warp away.
Conversation/acObj/Line00794=It appears that two warp conduits are active. Multiple waves of shuttles are in transit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00795=Another warp conduit has been activated. A wave of shuttles is headed toward it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00796=Two warp conduits are operating at once. A wave of shuttles is heading for each.
Conversation/acObj/Line00797=Ah, excellent. Our readings indicate three more waves of shuttles...
Conversation/acObj/Line00798=Only two waves of shuttles remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line00799=Prepare yourselves, commanders. The final wave of shuttles will be upon us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line00800=Shuttle heat signatures detected. They are launching many shuttles toward a single conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00802=They're sending all of the shuttles they have left. You must intercept them!
Conversation/acObj/Line00803=A well-deserved victory. The shuttles have been eliminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00804=A Void shard's been reported outside of your landing point, so that's your first objective. Best of luck out there.
Conversation/acObj/Line00805=This is Corporal Faraday of the Korhal Defense Force. Amon's troops have taken the city. They're summoning Void shards everywhere.
Conversation/acObj/Line00806=Several Void shards appearing on our sensors. Make sure you destroy all of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line00807=Numerous Void shards detected. We need to destroy them ASAP.
Conversation/acObj/Line00808=Not good. Multiple Void shards in play. Your objective is to take them out.
Conversation/acObj/Line00809=The field is blowing up with these Void shards. We need to put them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line00810=More Void shards are appearing. Destroying them is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line00811=That's another Void shard down. 
Conversation/acObj/Line00812=Void shard eliminated. Keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line00813=Good work on that Void shard.
Conversation/acObj/Line00814=Countdown's showing that Void shards are going to activate soon. That's not good.
Conversation/acObj/Line00815=Need to move against the Void shards soon. We're running out of time.
Conversation/acObj/Line00816=Time's almost up. We need to take out those Void shards!
Conversation/acObj/Line00817=We don't have much time left. Destroy the Void shards while we still can!
Conversation/acObj/Line00818=Kimeran pirates are taking advantage of the chaos to steal precious resources. Shoot those traitors out of the sky, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line00819=Pirate ship neutralized. Nothing worse than pirates and traitors.
Conversation/acObj/Line00826=Things are almost back under control. This is the last group of Void shards. Let's take back our city.
Conversation/acObj/Line00827=Clock's ticking. We need to get rid of those shards.
Conversation/acObj/Line00828=Didn't come this far to just drop the ball now. Demolish those Void shards!
Conversation/acObj/Line00831=Those filthy pirates are trying for another score. Let's lay down the law, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00832=Piracy in the skies above Korhal? Not on my watch.
Conversation/acObj/Line00833=That's all of the Void shards. The city is ours. You hear that, Amon? The Dominion is not so easily defeated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00836=The Zenith Stones near the temple have become unstable. It may be wise to dispose of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line00837=Amon is assailing the temple with a Void thrasher. It has to be eliminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00838=A Void thrasher is bombarding the temple. You must end its assault.
Conversation/acObj/Line00839=Amon's forces are attacking the temple.
Conversation/acObj/Line00840=The temple is under attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line00841=Amon has dealt considerable damage to the temple thus far. Bolster our defenses, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00842=The temple has suffered significant damage. It cannot sustain much more.
Conversation/acObj/Line00843=The temple is nearly destroyed. Do not allow it to fall!
Conversation/acObj/Line00844=The Zenith Stones have been destroyed. Regrettable, but necessary.
Conversation/acObj/Line00845=The Zenith Stones are no more, and their volatile energies have been quelled.
Conversation/acObj/Line00846=It pains me to see the Zenith Stones destroyed, but it had to be done.
Conversation/acObj/Line00847=The temple has been primed. Its activation will eradicate Amon's remaining forces. Well done, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00848=Got a contract you might wanna help me fill. Amon's using Tarsonis's old train system to ship some questionable Moebius cargo.
Conversation/acObj/Line00849=En Taro Adun, commanders. Our forces are engaging Amon's minions across Shakuras. But the Dark God seeks this temple's demise.
Conversation/acObj/Line00850=Half of the temple's configurations are complete. Remain steadfast until it can activate.
Conversation/acObj/Line00851=The temple is beginning to awaken! It won't be long before it activates itself.
Conversation/acObj/Line00852=The temple is nearly operational. Stand firm, commanders! The battle is almost won!
Conversation/acObj/Line00853=Zerg drop pods detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00854=Detecting zerg drop pods.
Conversation/acObj/Line00855=Multiple thrashers have emerged from the Void. Dispatch them before they destroy the temple.
Conversation/acObj/Line00856=Several Void thrashers are besieging the temple. They must be annihilated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00857=Looks like they've got another shipment leaving the station. Let's cause some delays.
Conversation/acObj/Line00858=Normally I'd encourage robbing a train like this. But with these guys... it's probably safer to light it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line00859=Got another fast one on the bottom track. Better move if you wanna take it out.
Conversation/acObj/Line00860=They're sending two trains at once now. Must be getting desperate... or serious. Can't say I like the sound of either.
Conversation/acObj/Line00861=Those trains on the third rail are fast as hell. Gotta take them out quick.
Conversation/acObj/Line00862=Oh no... warp sequences completed. The shuttles have escaped.
Conversation/acObj/Line00863=The shuttles have warped away. They are beyond reach.
Conversation/acObj/Line00865=A troubling number of shuttles have eluded us. We cannot let this continue.
Conversation/acObj/Line00868=Too many shuttles... Commanders, you must not allow any others to escape!
Conversation/acObj/Line00869=Good job torchin' those trains. From the intel I've been provided, I'd say half their stock is in flames.
Conversation/acObj/Line00870=They can't have much cargo left. Keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line00871=They got one past us. Can't let that happen again. Got a reputation to maintain.
Conversation/acObj/Line00872=Hey, seriously. Those trains can't get through, or we'll have a lot more than a broken contract to worry about.
Conversation/acObj/Line00873=Two departures inbound. Time to step up your game.
Conversation/acObj/Line00878=And that's a done deal. Been a pleasure working with you.
Conversation/acObj/Line00879=I've been hired to destroy those trains, but I don't have the personnel to do it. I'm thinking maybe you do. What do you say?
Conversation/acObj/Line00880=Greetings, commanders. Amon seeks to destroy Ulnar by capturing its celestial locks and allowing their energies to overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line00881=Your objective is to activate all five locks. It will take units from both of your armies to do so. Work together, and prevail.
Conversation/acObj/Line00882=Amon's forces have seized a celestial lock. Taking control of it before it overloads is your primary objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line00883=Once they activate, those shards will decimate Augustgrad. We need to destroy each of them before that happens. Don't let me down.
Conversation/acObj/Line00884=Sure blows up pretty, doesn't it? The enemy'll summon more soon. Guaranteed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00885=First train's departing. Your objective is to destroy it before it escapes.
Conversation/acObj/Line00886=Got a train on that bottom track, moving fast. Must be a priority shipment. Intercept it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line00887=It will take time to activate the temple's power and repel his assault. Your objective is to defend it until that time comes.
Conversation/acObj/Line00888=Another Void thrasher is on the battlefield.
Conversation/acObj/Line00889=Multiple Void thrashers have appeared.
Conversation/acObj/Line00890=Void thrashers have been summoned.
Conversation/acObj/Line00891=Additional Void thrashers have appeared.
Conversation/acObj/Line00892=Multiple Void thrashers detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00893=Void thrashers detected. Engagement advised.
Conversation/acObj/Line00894=A Void thrasher's death has been confirmed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00895=Void thrasher eliminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00896=A Void thrasher has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00897=Void thrasher neutralized.
Conversation/acObj/Line00898=Zerg drop pods detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00899=Detecting zerg drop pods.
Conversation/acObj/Line00902=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00903=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00904=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00905=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00906=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00907=Multiple Void thrashers have appeared.
Conversation/acObj/Line00908=Several Void thrashers have been summoned.
Conversation/acObj/Line00909=Additional Void thrashers are now on the battlefield.
Conversation/acObj/Line00910=Multiple Void thrashers detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00911=Void thrashers detected. Engage them when ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line00912=A new Void thrasher has emerged on the battlefield.
Conversation/acObj/Line00913=A Void thrasher has been annihilated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00914=Void thrasher obliterated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00915=We have slain a Void thrasher.
Conversation/acObj/Line00916=Void thrasher defeated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00917=Enemy zerg drop pods are inbound.
Conversation/acObj/Line00918=Incoming enemy zerg drop pods.
Conversation/acObj/Line00935=We have activated a celestial lock. It would be wise to defend it as we work to secure the others.
Conversation/acObj/Line00936=Another lock is now under our control.
Conversation/acObj/Line00937=We have secured another lock. Continue, and we will succeed in thwarting Amon's plan.
Conversation/acObj/Line00938=Another lock has now been activated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00939=A celestial lock has fallen into Amon's grasp. We must wrest control of it before it's too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line00940=Amon has turned one of Ulnar's constructs to his will. If you can, destroy it and free it from its ill fate.
Conversation/acObj/Line00941=The construct is no more. The Dark God will not corrupt the xel'naga's works so easily.
Conversation/acObj/Line00942=The enemy is attempting to capture a celestial lock.
Conversation/acObj/Line00943=Amon's forces are moving to seize a celestial lock.
Conversation/acObj/Line00944=A celestial lock will soon be under enemy control.
Conversation/acObj/Line00945=Amon's minions have taken a lock in his name. This cannot go unanswered.
Conversation/acObj/Line00946=The enemy has seized a celestial lock. We must take it back.
Conversation/acObj/Line00947=The locks are halfway toward the point of overloading. We must activate all five of them to seal Ulnar's power reserves.
Conversation/acObj/Line00948=Ulnar speeds towards destruction. If we do not activate the locks soon, Ulnar will be obliterated!
Conversation/acObj/Line00949=The locks are nearly overloaded! We must activate them now, or we will all be destroyed in the explosion!
Conversation/acObj/Line00950=All five celestial locks have been activated. Amon will be unable to bypass them again. Well done, commanders. Ulnar is saved.
Conversation/acObj/Line00951=More rifts. Thrashers can't be far behind. Get ready torch 'em, would ya?
Conversation/acObj/Line00952=The rifts are opening! Won't be long before we gotta light up some thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line00953=Think I hear some Void thrashers knockin' on our door. Let's get ready to answer.
Conversation/acObj/Line00954=The shuttles are no more.
Conversation/acObj/Line00955=You have prevented the shuttles' escape.
Conversation/acObj/Line00956=Shuttles eliminated, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00957=A wave of shuttles has been shot down.
Conversation/acObj/Line00959=Shuttle warping is imminent. They must be stopped!
Conversation/acObj/Line00960=Hurry... the shuttles are about to warp away!
Conversation/acObj/Line00961=It seems we were unable to stop all of the shuttles before they warped away.
Conversation/acObj/Line00964=The shuttles have made it through the warp conduit. We have no way to track them.
Conversation/acObj/Line00965=One fewer Void shard for us to deal with.
Conversation/acObj/Line00966=It'll take more than a few Void shards to defeat the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line00967=Excellent work, commanders. That Void shard is toast.
Conversation/acObj/Line00968=You've neutralized another Void shard. Well done.
Conversation/acObj/Line00969=Another Void shard has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00970=They keep summoning shards, and we keep sending them back.
Conversation/acObj/Line00971=We have to break apart those shards before they activate. Get moving!
Conversation/acObj/Line00972=Running out of time, commanders! Tear down those shards!
Conversation/acObj/Line00973=The temple is under siege from a Void thrasher. Slay it before it deals too much damage.
Conversation/acObj/Line00974=Amon has summoned a Void thrasher. It will severely harm the temple for as long as it lives.
Conversation/acObj/Line00975=Amon has called forth numerous Void thrashers against us. Direct your forces accordingly.
Conversation/acObj/Line00976=It seems we will have to deal with more than one thrasher this time. Make haste, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00977=Amon strikes against the temple. We must defend it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00978=Heads up. Another train's in transit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00979=You got a train to catch, commanders. Don't wanna miss it, do you?
Conversation/acObj/Line00980=They've loaded up another train. Make sure that cargo doesn't get delivered.
Conversation/acObj/Line00981=Incoming train. Do whatever it takes to derail it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00982=Here we go. Knock that train over and raise some hell.
Conversation/acObj/Line00983=Trains are leaving both stations at once. Guess they're trying to stay on schedule.
Conversation/acObj/Line00984=Damn! They've destroyed my fortress! We gotta get outta here, now!
Conversation/acObj/Line00985=The warp conduits are powering down... Amon must have warped all the troops he requires... who knows what they'll destroy now...
Conversation/acObj/Line00986=No! The shards are activating! Evacuate the city! We've lost Augustgrad!
Conversation/acObj/Line00987=By the gods... the temple! It's... Commanders, the battle is lost. The temple is destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00988=I'm not used to jobs going south like this. Pack it up, commanders. Show's over.
Conversation/acObj/Line00989=A few shuttles have managed to warp off-planet. We must ensure that the remaining shuttles do not.
Conversation/acObj/Line00990=Scans indicate that not every shuttle in that wave was destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00991=Hm. It seems that at least a portion of that wave was able to escape.
Conversation/acObj/Line00992=Residual warp energy detected. Some of the shuttles must have made it through.
Conversation/acObj/Line00993=We're picking up outbound warp signatures. Some shuttles must have escaped.
Conversation/acObj/Line00996=The research vessel is reporting incoming enemy forces. Commanders, they need your help!
Conversation/acObj/Line00997=Hostile elements are en route the to the research vessel. They require your protection!
Conversation/acObj/Line00998=Mayday! The research vessel is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line00999=The enemy is attacking our research vessel! Those scientists are defenseless!
Conversation/acObj/Line01000=Well, speak of the devil. Looks like one of those thrashers is about to come around.
Conversation/acObj/Line01001=All right, time to punch in! Your objective is to knock down that thrasher.
Conversation/acObj/Line01002=Got some intel that says we got two groups of thrashers left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01003=That's the last group of thrashers! Take 'em out, and we're home free!
Conversation/acObj/Line01004=Now that was a fight! Just gotta do it three more times, is all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01005=Two thrashers left! Let's show 'em how to tango.
Conversation/acObj/Line01006=Last thrasher! Make that one pay for scratchin' up my paint job!
Conversation/acObj/Line01007=Moebius has an Archangel!? I've been tryin'a get one myself for years! Listen, if you can, do me a favor. Torch that thing so I can rebuild it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01008=Woo! I have got to get me one of those!
Conversation/acObj/Line01009=All that, just to high tail it outta here? Moebius Corps oughta be ashamed of themselves!
Conversation/acObj/Line01010=My fortress is takin' some serious hits. Clear out those thrashers before it gets too hot too handle.
Conversation/acObj/Line01011=My fortress can't take much more punishment. You gotta do somethin' about those thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line01012=The fortress's about to collapse! A few more hits and we're done for!
Conversation/acObj/Line01013=Fortress is comin' down! We gotta abandon it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01014=Couldn't have done it better myself, commanders. Woo! You ever have need of a tank jockey, I'm your gal. (laughs)
Conversation/acObj/Line01015=Right on time, commanders! These Void thrashers are tearin' up my base and they ain't gonna let up anytime soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01017=They got my men pinned down, so it's up to you to stop 'em. Nix those thrashers fast, before they blast my fortress apart!
Conversation/acObj/Line01018=Man, am I glad to see the two of you! My base is gettin' slammed by these Void thrashers, and it can't take much more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01019=I'm too busy fightin' fires in here to handle 'em myself. You gotta destroy those thrashers before they destroy this fortress!
Conversation/acObj/Line01020=See that rift over yonder? That's how a thrasher appears on the battlefield. Get ready to welcome it, would ya?
Conversation/acObj/Line01021=There's the first thrasher! Main objective is to kill it, and fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line01022=I'm hearin' that there should only be two groups of thrashers left. Get ready to take 'em out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01023=Almost there, commanders! This is the last group of thrashers!
Conversation/acObj/Line01024=Looks like there are three thrashers left. Time to drop that down to zero!
Conversation/acObj/Line01025=Just two to go. Dust 'em, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01026=This is it! The last thrasher! Let's end this thing.
Conversation/acObj/Line01027=<Low whistle> Would ya look at that? An Archangel! Probably a good idea to destroy it before they can use it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01028=That's it? Thought that thing would put up more of a fight!
Conversation/acObj/Line01029=Ah hell, it got away! Guess we just didn't have the firepower to take it down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01030=That's the last of 'em! With the Void thrashers gone, my boys can handle the rest. Thank ya kindly, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01031=Greetings, commanders. My fellow scientists have determined that Amon is using Kaldir as a staging ground for his troop shuttles.
Conversation/acObj/Line01032=The warp conduits he uses cannot be attacked, so you will need to destroy the shuttles themselves before they can warp away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01033=Thank you for responding to our call. It seems Amon is using Kaldir's warp conduits to transport his troops across the sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line01034=You won't be able to destroy the warp conduits, but you can destroy the shuttles. You must do so before they leave the planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01035=The central warp conduit is active. Amon will surely attempt to send his shuttles through it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01036=The central warp conduit is now online. It won't be long before Amon's shuttles depart for it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01037=Several shuttles are en route to the central warp conduit. Your objective is to eliminate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01038=We've located your main objective. You must destroy the shuttles headed for the central conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01039=Another wave of shuttles is headed for a warp conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01040=We're detecting your main objective, a wave of shuttles inbound on an active conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01041=A wave of shuttles is making its way to an active warp conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01042=A warp conduit is powering up, and a wave of shuttles is bearing toward it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01043=Detecting two active warp conduits. They both have shuttles inbound on their positions.
Conversation/acObj/Line01044=Two warp conduits have come online. Your objective is to stop both waves of shuttles from escaping.
Conversation/acObj/Line01045=It seems they are focusing all of their shuttles on a single warp conduit this time. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01046=Only one warp conduit this time, but it has a large number of incoming shuttles.
Conversation/acObj/Line01047=All shuttles are en route to a single warp conduit. Your objective is to stop them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01048=They appear to be launching more shuttles toward the warp conduits.
Conversation/acObj/Line01049=All of their remaining shuttles are inbound! They must be stopped!
Conversation/acObj/Line01050=We're reading multiple signatures in flight. They're sending all the shuttles they have left!
Conversation/acObj/Line01051=According to our scans, three waves of shuttles remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01052=From what we've gathered, I'd say they have three waves of shuttles left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01053=By my calculations, there are two waves of shuttles left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01054=There should only be two waves of shuttles left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01055=I believe we have eliminated all but the final wave of shuttles.
Conversation/acObj/Line01056=These readings suggest that only one wave of shuttles remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01057=Some shuttles have slipped past our blockade, commanders. Take care not to let others do the same.
Conversation/acObj/Line01058=Despite our efforts, a few shuttles have escaped. We cannot not allow others to pass.
Conversation/acObj/Line01059=Quite a few shuttles have warped away. If this continues, our efforts will be for naught.
Conversation/acObj/Line01060=The number of escaped shuttles is alarming. Commanders, the line must be held.
Conversation/acObj/Line01061=If any more shuttles warp away, then our actions will be futile!
Conversation/acObj/Line01062=This isn't good... we must destroy these shuttles at all costs, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01063=Kaldir's xel'naga shrines may contain invaluable knowledge. My team is setting out to scan them, but they will require protection.
Conversation/acObj/Line01064=Amon has taken an interest in some nearby xel'naga shrines. Our researchers will investigate, but they will need to be guarded.
Conversation/acObj/Line01065=Our scientists are detecting an inbound enemy presence. Please safeguard them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01066=Our scientists are under attack! They'll never survive without help!
Conversation/acObj/Line01067=It seems they've sent all the shuttles they need. We did our best, but it seems Amon's armies will grow stronger nonetheless.
Conversation/acObj/Line01068=You've succeeded in thwarting Amon's plan! Our research facility -- and the sector -- owe you a great debt, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01069=Amon has no more shuttles to send. Now he will be unable to reinforce his armies. Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01070=Corporal Faraday reporting in with a sitrep, commanders. Amon's forces are summoning Void shards all across the city.
Conversation/acObj/Line01071=We're looking at total devastation if they're allowed to activate. I need you to take down those shards while there's still time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01072=Corporal Faraday here. We're in it deep, commanders. Amon's summoning Void shards in multiple locations around the city.
Conversation/acObj/Line01073=Their activation will result in the city's destruction and catastrophic civilian casualties. We need to destroy those shards.
Conversation/acObj/Line01074=Scanner's picking up a Void shard near your location. Your objective is to take it out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01075=Sending you the location of your main objective. Now that Void shard needs to be destroyed posthaste, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01076=And that's how it's done. Good work. Just gotta do the same to the rest of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01077=That's just the first of many. Okay, commanders. Let's get to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01078=Only one group of shards left. Crush them into dust and end this fight.
Conversation/acObj/Line01079=Home stretch, commanders. One more group of shards to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01080=Those Kimeran pirates are trying to steal from us during an attack on the city. I'd appreciate it if you could exterminate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01081=That pirate scum ransacks the city at a time like this? I know it's a personal request, but if you can... please kill them all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01082=These pirates just don't learn, do they? Commanders, it's time to educate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01083=These wretched pirates are about to get a helluva lot more than they bargained for. Take them out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01084=That's the thing about the Dominion. Even in a crisis, our rule of law holds firm.
Conversation/acObj/Line01085=Damn it, we're out of time! Pull back, commanders. We have to get everyone out of the city!
Conversation/acObj/Line01086=Korhal is in your debt, commanders. You've saved a lot of lives today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01087=I bet Amon didn't count on the two of you joining the fray. Way to make him regret it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01088=The war against Amon rages, commanders. His forces descend upon this xel'naga temple as we speak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01089=It has yet to fall, but it will not last long. Your objective is to defend it until its activation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01090=Thank the gods you are here, commanders. We do not have much time before Amon assails this temple.
Conversation/acObj/Line01091=Its activation has begun, but it needs more time to be completed. Defending the temple until then is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01092=Amon's assault on the temple is beginning to take its toll. We must be vigilant in its defense.
Conversation/acObj/Line01093=Beware, commanders! Amon's forces have severely damaged the temple. We must fight to protect it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01094=Amon has nearly destroyed the temple! We must prevent him from succeeding!
Conversation/acObj/Line01095=The temple is halfway toward activation. Maintain our defenses, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01096=The temple's preparations are proceeding as planned. Stay strong in your defense.
Conversation/acObj/Line01097=Excellent, the temple's mechanisms are aligning properly. It will soon be ready for activation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01098=Our defenses are proving effective. Soon the temple will be ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line01099=Preparations are nearly complete, commanders! Defend the temple for just a few more moments!
Conversation/acObj/Line01100=The temple's activation is nigh. Continue our defenses, commanders! It is almost time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01101=The temple's Zenith Stones are reacting to our actions. I suggest demolishing them for safety's sake.
Conversation/acObj/Line01102=It seems the nearby Zenith Stones are becoming volatile. It is unfortunate, but it may be prudent for us to destroy them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01103=Only one of the unstable Zenith Stones remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01104=We have eliminated all but one of the volatile Zenith Stones.
Conversation/acObj/Line01105=There remains one last Zenith Stone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01106=Abandon our defenses, commanders. The temple is lost. Amon has won this battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line01107=The temple is ready for activation. Well fought, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01108=Preparations are complete. Our defenses have held and the temple stands ready. Victory is ours, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01109=Glad you're here. Need a little help fulfilling a contract. Amon's shipping some nasty tech onboard these trains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01110=My job is to torch 'em, but my guys are late to the party. Now, I'm thinking you'd like to see those trains go up in smoke, too.
Conversation/acObj/Line01111=Fancy seeing you here. Guess it's my lucky day. Dominion's hired me to destroy some trains carrying dangerous Moebius ordnance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01112=Seeing as how Amon's a mutual enemy, maybe you'd like to step up to the plate. I could use a partner or two on this.
Conversation/acObj/Line01113=One of the trains is leaving its station now. Destroying it is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01114=Got eyes on your objective. Blow up that train before it reaches its destination.
Conversation/acObj/Line01115=There's a train booking it on the bottom track. If you wanna catch it, you're gonna have to move fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line01116=Trains on that bottom track are faster than the others. You can try and stop 'em, but you gotta be quick.
Conversation/acObj/Line01117=Trains are departing from both stations. Gotta move fast to hit them both.
Conversation/acObj/Line01118=Got a pair of trains, one from each station. Better step on it, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01119=Two trains, leaving simultaneously. Looks like your dance card's full.
Conversation/acObj/Line01120=Contract offers a big bonus for hitting the trains on the third rail. But don't do it for me, do it for the good of the sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line01121=Client's willing to pay extra if you take out the trains on the bottom track. You take 'em out, Amon's mad and I'm happy. Win-win.
Conversation/acObj/Line01122=We've taken out about half of their trains. Nice work, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01123=Looks like we're making good progress. We've knocked over roughly half of their shipments.
Conversation/acObj/Line01124=I reckon they're running out of hardware to ship. Almost got 'em, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01125=Their warehouses should be looking real empty right now. Not too many trains left to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01126=One of their trains got through. That cargo is bad news for everyone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01127=Damn, they managed to get a train into station. We can't let them do that again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01128=That's two trains that've gotten past us. Don't let another one by, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01129=This is bad. We fail to stop one more shipment, and this entire op is as burned out as Chau Sara.
Conversation/acObj/Line01130=That's all she wrote, commanders. They've delivered enough hardware that anything we do now is wasted effort.
Conversation/acObj/Line01131=That was some impressive work, commanders. You ever want to get into the merc business, gimme a call.
Conversation/acObj/Line01132=Another contract fulfilled. You got my thanks, commanders. But not my cut. <Laughs>
Conversation/acObj/Line01133=A celestial lock is under Amon's control. Your objective is to reclaim it before it overloads.
Conversation/acObj/Line01134=Amon's followers have taken control of a celestial lock. It is your objective to take it back before it overloads.
Conversation/acObj/Line01135=We have laid claim to one of the celestial locks. We must hold it until the others are ours, as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01136=We must activate all five locks in order to stop him. Units from both of your armies must be present to complete your objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01137=You arrived just in time, commanders. Amon is attempting to destroy Ulnar by overloading its celestial locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01138=Our plans to enter the Void are in jeopardy. Amon intends to destroy Ulnar by overloading its celestial locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01139=Activating all five locks is your objective. Units from both of your armies must stand together near a lock to activate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01140=A lock has been activated. We must endeavor to keep it that way.
Conversation/acObj/Line01141=We are one step closer to regaining full control of the celestial locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01142=Each lock we activate slows Amon's progress. We must continue.
Conversation/acObj/Line01143=We have activated another lock. Press on, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01145=We have activated four of the locks. We need only do the same to the fifth.
Conversation/acObj/Line01146=That is the fourth lock under our control. Once we activate the final one, Amon will be defeated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01147=Our foe has captured one of the locks. Reclaiming it is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01148=Amon's forces have taken control of a celestial lock. Your primary objective is to activate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01149=Amon's minions are contesting a lock. They will soon gain control of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01150=We cannot allow Amon's army to take control of this lock.
Conversation/acObj/Line01151=A xel'naga construct has been corrupted by Amon's Void energies. It would be an act of mercy to destroy it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01152=It seems Amon has gained control of a xel'naga construct. This is sacrilege, commanders. Destroy it if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01153=You have destroyed the construct. Amon can no longer use it against us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01154=Amon has lost his defiled construct. Exemplary work, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01155=Amon's forces have brought Ulnar halfway towards its destruction. We must hurry to activate the locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01156=Half of Ulnar's energies have become volatile and unstable. The locks must be activated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01157=The energies within Ulnar are raging against each other. You must activate the locks, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01158=Amon has destabilized the majority of Ulnar's power. We must activate the locks before it's too late!
Conversation/acObj/Line01159=Amon is dangerously close to destroying Ulnar! You must activate the locks at once!
Conversation/acObj/Line01160=We must not allow Ulnar to be obliterated! Activate the locks while there's still time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01161=Ulnar... the cradle of life... we could not save it from Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01162=Without Ulnar, we cannot enter the Void... and Amon will be free to regain his strength uncontested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01163=Once again, Amon's minions fall before our conviction. Now to open the gate to the Void, and end him once and for all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01164=The locks are in place and Ulnar's energies have been stabilized. We can now use the temple to enter the Void and put an end to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01165=Amon's forces are moving upon a celestial lock. If they gain control of it, the lock will begin to overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line01166=A celestial lock is being claimed by Amon. If left uncontested, it will fall under his control and begin to destabilize Ulnar.
Conversation/acObj/Line01167=Amon's army is attempting to secure a celestial lock. It will begin to overload if they succeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01168=Three of the locks are now ours. We must secure the remaining two.
Conversation/acObj/Line01169=Three locks have been activated. If we secure the two that are left, we will have saved Ulnar.
Conversation/acObj/Line01170=We have managed to reclaim three of the five locks. Two more, and our battle is won.
Conversation/acObj/Line01171=Four of the five locks are under our control. Only one remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01178=Amon has activated all three warp conduits! Hurry, commanders! We must stop the shuttles!
Conversation/acObj/Line01179=All three warp conduits are active! We must make haste to prevent their escape!
Conversation/acObj/Line01180=Shuttles are on course for all three conduits! We will have to split our forces to stop them all!
Conversation/acObj/Line01181=Damn pirates! If we weren't busy defending the city, they'd be a burning wreckage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01182=Don't sweat it, commanders. Concentrate on saving the city. I'll hunt down that scum later.
Conversation/acObj/Line01183=They got away, huh? Once we're done here, I'll see to them personally.
Conversation/acObj/Line01184=Nothing I hate more than pirates. They got away today, but they won't evade me forever.
Conversation/acObj/Line01185=Let those cowards run, commanders. We'll get 'em next time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01186=Here come the thrashers, commanders! Let's light 'em up!
Conversation/acObj/Line01187=Lock and load! It's time to clear out some thrashers!
Conversation/acObj/Line01188=The Void thrashers are on the field! Take 'em out, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01189=There's your objective, commanders. Show those thrashers who's boss!
Conversation/acObj/Line01190=Looks like the thrashers have arrived. Let's kick 'em back to the Void!
Conversation/acObj/Line01191=Your objective is to activate all five locks. You must place units from your army within the lock's vicinity to do so.
Conversation/acObj/Line01192=We must activate all five locks in order to stop him. Units from your army must be near a lock to complete your objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01193=Activating all five locks is your objective. Units from your army must stand near a lock to activate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01194=Heads up, commanders! That Archangel is on the move. Probably gonna start repairing itself 'til it's under fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01195=Looks like that Archangel is makin' a break for it. I reckon it'll try repairing itself 'til you engage it again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01196=That Archangel's tryin' for some evasive maneuvers. My money's on it repairing itself 'til you start shootin' at it again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01197=Archangel's makin' a tactical retreat. Most likely to repair itself. Sooner you attack it, sooner those repairs will stop.
Conversation/acObj/Line01198=Well fought, commanders. Two Zentith Stones remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01199=You have successfully shattered a Zenith Stone. Two more await you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01200=Your conviction is admirable, commanders. We have two more Zenith Stones to address.
Conversation/acObj/Line01201=Scanners are picking up multiple Void shards. Our mission is to obliterate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01202=Multiple Void shards are active on the field. Eliminate them with extreme prejudice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01203=No rest for the righteous. Looks like we've got another set of Void shards to deal with.
Conversation/acObj/Line01204=Don't get too cozy, commanders. More Void shards have appeared and our time is short.
Conversation/acObj/Line01205=Detecting newly summoned Void shards. It's our job to blast them apart.
Conversation/acObj/Line01206=Look alive, commanders. It won't be long before that Void shard decimates the city.
Conversation/acObj/Line01207=Not long until Void shard activation. You have to destroy that shard before then.
Conversation/acObj/Line01208=Keep an eye on the clock, commanders. Don't let it run out before you destroy that Void shard.
Conversation/acObj/Line01209=We need to get moving! That Void shard's gonna activate soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01210=We're almost out of time! That Void shard has to be destroyed immediately!
Conversation/acObj/Line01211=Time is not on our side, commanders! Eliminate that Void shard while you still can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01212=Now that's what I like to see. Void shard terminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01213=I see your reputations are well earned. These Void shards are dropping like flies.
Conversation/acObj/Line01214=And another Void shard crumbles into dust. Well done, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01215=Not today, Amon. We'll obliterate every Void shard you stick in the ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01216=Looks like you've nixed another Void shard, commanders. I'm impressed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01217=It's been a tough fight, but there should only be one group of Void thrashers left!
Conversation/acObj/Line01218=Sounds like we've busted up all but the last group of thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line01219=Only one group of thrashers left, commanders. We can do this!
Conversation/acObj/Line01220=Amon's forces now control multiple locks. The more they control, the faster they will overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line01221=Our enemies have seized a number of locks. The overloading process hastens with each lock they control.
Conversation/acObj/Line01222=We must activate the locks as soon as possible. The more Amon controls, the faster they all overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line01223=Each lock Amon's army controls quickens the overloading. It is imperative that we take back the locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01224=The locks are overloading at an increasing rate, now that Amon holds more than one. Activate the locks quickly, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01225=I am Ji'nara, First Ascendant of the Tal'darim. One of Amon's remaining loyalists has dared to challenge me to Rak'Shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01226=He seeks to climb the Chain and become Highlord. Keep your armies close to me. With their psionic support, I will end his ascent.
Conversation/acObj/Line01227=The rite of Rak'Shir will soon begin. Amon's loyalists seek to regain control of the Tal'darim by climbing the Chain of Ascension.
Conversation/acObj/Line01228=As First Ascendant, I will exterminate these traitors. Both of your armies must stand with me to provide their psionic support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01229=I am First Ascendant Ji'nara, and I have been challenged to Rak'Shir by a faction of Tal'darim who foolishly remain loyal to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01230=The Dark God bolsters their champion's strength. Send both of your armies to my side to bolster mine. I will emerge victorious.
Conversation/acObj/Line01231=Both of you must support me. Send your armies to me at once.
Conversation/acObj/Line01232=You must position both of your armies nearby in order to support me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01233=Only one army? That is not enough! Both of your armies must stand near me to offer their support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01234=I thought there were two of you in this fight. I expect support from both. Send your armies to my side.
Conversation/acObj/Line01235=Both of your armies must support me, commanders. No half measures. Move them near me at once.
Conversation/acObj/Line01236=Yes, your power courses through me. Soon, Amon's champion will fall into the abyss.
Conversation/acObj/Line01237=The power you offer me will be the end of these fools. Maintaining this support is your primary objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01238=Now that I have your support, I can slay this traitorous filth.
Conversation/acObj/Line01239=Excellent. With your assistance, I will put an end to this reckless insubordination.
Conversation/acObj/Line01240=The support from your armies will prove useful. Your objective is to continue providing it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01241=Amon sends reinforcements to support his champion. Prepare to meet them in combat.
Conversation/acObj/Line01242=It seems Amon's lackeys are moving toward their champion. Intercept them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01243=The enemy is sending forces to support their champion. Match their strength.
Conversation/acObj/Line01244=Enemy supplicants are headed toward their champion. Kill them all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01245=A group of enemies seeks to support Amon's champion. Do not allow that to happen.
Conversation/acObj/Line01246=Amon's champion draws power from his supplicants. Eliminate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01247=Enemy forces are supporting their champion psionically. They must be destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01248=The enemy is providing their champion with psionic support. You must deny him their aid.
Conversation/acObj/Line01249=These traitors are seething with Amon's power. Slay them so they cannot support their champion.
Conversation/acObj/Line01250=Amon's worshipers are augmenting their champion's power. Do not allow this to continue.
Conversation/acObj/Line01251=You have slain the enemy champion's supplicants and taken away his support. Admirable brutality.
Conversation/acObj/Line01252=The enemy's supplicants have been annihilated. Such is the fate of all who kneel to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01253=What fools, to think they can seize control of the Tal'darim. When Alarak's rule ends, it will be my doing, and mine alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01254=The Tal'darim will not fall back into Amon's grasp. These traitors will be cut from the chain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01255=Ascension is only for the worthy. Amon's pitiful lackeys hardly qualify.
Conversation/acObj/Line01256=Your armies have been routed. You must replace them without delay, before I lose too much ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01257=Amon's forces have eradicated your armies and taken away my support. Provide me with more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01258=Is this the best your armies can offer? The enemy has torn them apart. Send more to my side immediately.
Conversation/acObj/Line01259=These losses are unacceptable. You must not allow Amon's champion to remain uncontested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01260=You have underestimated Amon's strength. Do not do so again. Commit additional forces at once.
Conversation/acObj/Line01261=You must send your armies to support me so I can decimate this rebellion.
Conversation/acObj/Line01262=I require supplicants if I am to quell this uprising. Do not delay in sending me your armies.
Conversation/acObj/Line01263=Position both of your armies nearby to grant me power. I will need them in order to win Rak'Shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01264=I will not allow Amon's champion to prevail. Send your armies to me at once!
Conversation/acObj/Line01265=I did not call upon you for idle chatter. The psionic support from your armies is the key to my victory. Move them near me now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01266=Amon's champion is losing ground. It won't be long before he falls to his doom.
Conversation/acObj/Line01267=Your support is proving effective. The enemy champion cannot hope to overcome it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01268=I am overwhelming the enemy champion. Continue to pledge your power to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01269=These rebels have an entrenched position up ahead. You must destroy their encampment if I am to end this farce.
Conversation/acObj/Line01270=It seems the enemy has established fortifications on the path to the pit. Be prepared to set them ablaze.
Conversation/acObj/Line01271=An enemy base stands in the way of my victory. Tear it down and grind the rubble into dust.
Conversation/acObj/Line01272=Oblivion awaits Amon's minions. Maintain your psionic support and I shall deliver them unto it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01273=The hour is nearly at hand. Keep your armies close to me, so that I might strike the killing blow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01274=It is time to conclude this duel. Give me your power. I will rip Amon's champion apart.
Conversation/acObj/Line01275=I am losing ground. Send me support immediately, unless you wish to lose the Tal'darim to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01276=Amon grants his champion unnatural strength. I must siphon power from your armies if I am to regain the ground I have lost.
Conversation/acObj/Line01277=You have allowed Amon's champion to gain considerable ground. Correct this error!
Conversation/acObj/Line01278=I am nearly upon the pit of sacrifice. Push back against Amon's champion soon, or lose the Tal'darim!
Conversation/acObj/Line01279=Amon's champion has advanced within sight of the pit. This cannot stand! Match his strength before he succeeds!
Conversation/acObj/Line01280=Are you here to aid me in this rite or not? I have nearly fallen back to the pit!
Conversation/acObj/Line01281=Support me with your armies now, or I will cross the edge of the pit! 
Conversation/acObj/Line01282=Send your armies to me immediately! All is nearly lost!
Conversation/acObj/Line01283=Amon's champion is moments away from victory! If I am thrown into that pit, I am taking you with me!
Conversation/acObj/Line01284=The elementals of Slayn may interfere with Rak'Shir if they wander too close to us. Slaughter them, if possible.
Conversation/acObj/Line01285=I sense several elementals nearby. Their psionic bleating is distracting me. Silence them, if you have the forces to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line01286=These lumbering elementals have always irritated me. Wipe them out, if your armies are strong enough to be divided.
Conversation/acObj/Line01287=I see you have slain one of the elementals. Two more remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01288=These elementals have always been a nuisance. Exterminate the remaining two.
Conversation/acObj/Line01289=The first beast is dead. Kill the other two as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01290=The elemental has encased one of your warriors in a cocoon. I suggest you break them out before they are devoured.
Conversation/acObj/Line01291=One of your warriors seems to have been encased in the elemental's cocoon. Will you break them out, or leave them to die?
Conversation/acObj/Line01292=How amusing. One of your warriors is trapped in the elemental's cocoon. How long can they survive without you breaking them out?
Conversation/acObj/Line01293=Another elemental vanquished. Only one remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01294=Two elementals have met their demise. See to it that the third one joins them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01295=Such troublesome creatures. Slay the last one when you have the chance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01296=All of the elementals have been eradicated. Now return your full attention to Rak'Shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01297=One day, I will render those elementals extinct. But for now, let us focus our efforts on the task at hand.
Conversation/acObj/Line01298=You have destroyed all of the elementals in the surrounding area. Your penchant for violence is impressive.
Conversation/acObj/Line01299=No! This cannot be! I am the First Ascendant! I...
Conversation/acObj/Line01300=You have doomed the Tal'darim, commanders! I will haunt you for all eternity! Do you hear me!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01301=And so ends Rak'Shir. What a pathetic display. When the day comes, I hope Alarak proves to be a more fitting challenge.
Conversation/acObj/Line01302=Victory is mine. You make for effective supplicants, commanders. I will remember that when I challenge Alarak to Rak'shir myself.
Conversation/acObj/Line01303=Let this be a lesson to all who dare to challenge me. Commanders, I commend your strength in battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line01304=Highlord, Amon's followers linger within our ranks. Their champion has challenged me to Rak'shir in order to usurp the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01305=This insubordination must be punished. I will require psionic support from both your supplicants as well as your partner's army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01306=Highlord Alarak. An ascendant who remains loyal to Amon has challenged me to Rak'shir. We must stand together to crush him.
Conversation/acObj/Line01307=Psionic support from both you and your ally would make me unbeatable. Declare for me, and we will obliterate this traitor.
Conversation/acObj/Line01308=The Tal'darim are at odds with each other, Highlord. A faction of Amon worshipers seeks to stage a coup via the rite of Rak'shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01309=We both know this cannot stand. I must win this challenge, and to do that I need both you and your ally to support me psionically.
Conversation/acObj/Line01310=It will take more than one army's power for me to overcome this challenger, Highlord. You must both commit your forces to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01311=Is there some reason only one army is offering me support? If you allow me to fail here, they will challenge you next, Highlord.
Conversation/acObj/Line01312=Without support from both armies, I will be unable to defeat this challenger. It's in your interest to assure my victory, Alarak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01313=Despite your confidence in my abilities, I must remind you that I require psionic support from both armies in order to win.
Conversation/acObj/Line01314=Alarak, you know better than anyone the importance of psionic support when challenged to Rak'shir. Both armies must provide it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01330=I see your blades have not dulled since becoming Highlord. I will remember that.
Conversation/acObj/Line01331=Your battlefield tactics are impressive, Alarak. I have ascertained much from observing them. Much indeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01332=You've broken the enemy's support. It cost you a few warriors, but no doubt you'll manage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01333=The enemy has made a grievous error. Their champion has lost his support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01334=A bold stratagem, Alarak. Brutally efficient at eliminating the enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01335=Amon's forces have wiped out your army, Highlord. Remember that the Chain of Ascension is only as strong as its weakest link.
Conversation/acObj/Line01336=I know this is not the full extent of your power, Alarak. Send me your best if you wish to maintain order within the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01337=It seems you've underestimated your opponent. I will keep that tendency in mind. But for now, I require reinforcements.
Conversation/acObj/Line01338=Your warriors have faltered, Alarak. I do pray this is not a common occurrence. Devote more of them to my support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01339=Has your strength waned since your ascension? Or are you trying to eliminate me as well? Win this fight, or lose the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01340=I did not inform you of this challenge so you could spectate, Alarak. I require psionic support from your army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01341=Highlord, I must be victorious if you are to keep hold of the Tal'darim. Send your forces to support me without delay.
Conversation/acObj/Line01342=Now is not the time to test my strength. Pledge your forces to my cause before it is too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line01343=You know how this works, Alarak. I need supplicants in order to win this challenge. Send them to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01344=Need I remind you that your objective is to support me? If you wish to see me thrown into the pit, then do it yourself.
Conversation/acObj/Line01354=I am losing ground, Highlord. You and your ally must support me, unless you wish your command to be usurped.
Conversation/acObj/Line01355=I expected more from you than this, Alarak. Are you intentionally holding back? Send me support so I can regain lost ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01356=The tide turns against me, Highlord. If you do not intervene with additional support, it will erode your rule as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01357=Highlord, I am nearly upon the pit of sacrifice. You must support me now, or Amon will be poised to conquer the Tal'darim anew!
Conversation/acObj/Line01358=I am within sight of the pit, Alarak. Support me now! I must not be defeated here! 
Conversation/acObj/Line01359=Is this the best the mighty Alarak can muster? If I lose here, the entire chain will belong to Amon once again!
Conversation/acObj/Line01360=Was Artanis's support during your own Rak'shir this ineffective? Do something, before Amon's champion wins!
Conversation/acObj/Line01361=I am inches away from the pit! What are you playing at, Alarak? Do you want this insurrection to succeed? 
Conversation/acObj/Line01362=Aid me now, Highlord, or forfeit the Tal'darim to Amon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01378=Curse you, Alarak! Was this your plan all along? You have doomed us all, you fool! Amon will come for you next!
Conversation/acObj/Line01379=You have failed, Highlord! All those incessant machinations, and for what? You have lost the Tal'darim!
Conversation/acObj/Line01380=Your rule of the Tal'darim holds for another day, Highlord. It seems the time for leadership to change is not yet upon us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01381=An impressive display, Alarak. Fear not, I have no intention of challenging you myself. Today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01382=My gratitude for your declaration in my favor, Highlord. It was... enlightening to see your tactics in practice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01383=Amon's hybrids are greatly enhancing his champion's strength. They must be eliminated immediately!
Conversation/acObj/Line01384=These hybrids possess immense psionic power. Destroy them, or that power will belong to their champion!
Conversation/acObj/Line01385=Massive psionic power flows into Amon's champion from the hybrids. Slay them quickly!
Conversation/acObj/Line01386=Psionic support from the hybrids turns the tide in Amon's favor. Put an end to it, now!
Conversation/acObj/Line01387=Hybrids... I cannot stand against them for long. Kill them before I am overwhelmed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01388=The elemental will not linger here for long. Do not tarry if you wish to destroy it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01389=I can sense the elemental's unrest. Slay it before it scurries away to breed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01390=The elemental will soon depart. I shall be glad to be rid of it, but I would prefer you kill it instead.
Conversation/acObj/Line01391=It won't be long before that elemental leaves this place. I'd like to see it torn apart before that happens.
Conversation/acObj/Line01392=You don't have long before the elemental escapes. Exterminate that pest before it does.
Conversation/acObj/Line01393=It seems the elemental has slipped through your fingers. A shame.
Conversation/acObj/Line01394=That elemental remains free to roam Slayn. No matter. Its death is inevitable. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01395=So, you were unable to slay the elemental. I will deal with it myself after Rak'shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01396=Is there no end to this elemental vermin? Crush this one if you can spare the warriors to do so.
Conversation/acObj/Line01397=Yet another elemental has wandered onto the field of battle. Deal with it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01398=I hate these detestable elementals. Eliminate them if you have the strength to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line01401=This is Donny Vermillion live in orbit around Veridia Prime: a once beautiful resort, now under assault by nefarious forces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01402=The plan is to have workers gather xenon crystals to restore the environmental stabilizer. But is that the whole story?
Conversation/acObj/Line01403=And we're back, live in orbit around Veridia Prime. Emperor Valerian's allies have finally arrived, but is it already too late?
Conversation/acObj/Line01404=The plan is for workers to gather xenon crystals to reactivate the stabilizer. Will it work? This reporter can only guess, no.
Conversation/acObj/Line01405=The resort world of Veridia was once a jewel in the Dominion's crown. Today, that jewel has cracked, metaphorically, AND by lava.
Conversation/acObj/Line01406=The planet's only hope? Two commanders, whose workers must refuel the stabilizer. Let's join the mission already in progress.
Conversation/acObj/Line01407=Earlier an unknown enemy technology destabilized Veridia's core, resulting in endless waves of lava. Another is on its way now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01409=The lava is rising! Let's hope the forces down there can reach high ground safely. (aside)Or not. We could use the ratings.
Conversation/acObj/Line01410=This report from Terry, our seismologist, who says seismic activity is increasing. That means lava. And it's coming soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01411=Here's the lava! Watch the low ground viewers, that's where the action is!
Conversation/acObj/Line01412=The commanders' workers should collect the crystals and bring them to the stabilizer soon. We'll be here when they begin!
Conversation/acObj/Line01414=This just in, the environmental stabilizer is at 25% and holding. Still a long way to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01415=The stabilizer has reached the halfway point. But it's still too early for celebration.
Conversation/acObj/Line01416=The stabilizer is 75% percent charged. So close, yet so far. Will they pull through?
Conversation/acObj/Line01418=Four minutes until Veridia's cataclysmic end. They can't hear me, but I'm sure the commanders know the pressure is on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01419=Two minutes left. The air in the studio is so thick (faking it)I can barely speak, (faking it harder)but I will... (back to normal)for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01420=Only one minute left! They need to be loading crystals like there's no tomorrow. Because there might not be.
Conversation/acObj/Line01421=Three minutes left. You can feel the tension is building.
Conversation/acObj/Line01422=Breaking news! A Molten Salamander the locals call "Molten Sal" has been drawn to the scene. It could create unimaginable chaos!
Conversation/acObj/Line01423=It looks like the Salamander has resurfaced. If the commanders are going to do something, now just might be the time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01424=This just in, Dominion allies slay an endangered animal. Was there really no other way?
Conversation/acObj/Line01425=A crushing defeat, and in my humble opinion, the blame falls squarely upon Valerian.
Conversation/acObj/Line01426=(surprised)The Dominion's allies are victorious... (recovering)But was plundering Veridia's natural resources worth it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01427=Air units caught within a deadly lava spout. I can't see the damage, but if I were to guess? Total devastation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01428=The commanders need to be careful. Spouts of magma can reach into the upper stratosphere, even taking out spacecraft!
Conversation/acObj/Line01429=As quickly as it surges, the lava recedes. Now it's up to the workers to reach those new crystal formations in time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01430=They won? Cut the feed... I can't use this! What do you mean we're still live?
Conversation/acObj/Line01431=A great victory. Thanks to your intrepid reporter, Donny Vermillion. (aside)Bet I get a Sammy award for this one!
Conversation/acObj/Line01432=The tell-tale rumbling has begun. I expect we'll be seeing a lava surge soon, and a big one!
Conversation/acObj/Line01433=Our seismologist believes the coming lava surge is breaching the mantle--Terry, this is boring science stuff! I'm not reading this!
Conversation/acObj/Line01434=A jolt of seismic activity rocks the surface of Veridia Prime. The lava won't be too far behind!
Conversation/acObj/Line01435=Another increase in seismic activity! A lava surge is coming. Will this finally be the big one?
Conversation/acObj/Line01436=That earthquake only signals one thing... Another lava surge is coming soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01437=Another quake. Another lava surge coming soon. Trust Donny Vermillion to get you the updates you need.
Conversation/acObj/Line01438=I've just gotten an update... (dramatic)The lava is here!
Conversation/acObj/Line01439=Word is the lava is hitting now. Let's go live to the planetary feed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01440=Another lava surge is here. Evacuation of the low ground had better be underway!
Conversation/acObj/Line01441=I'm getting a report that the lava is surging right now. Let's switch to lava cam six!
Conversation/acObj/Line01442=The lava has arrived once more... and UNN's film crew is on the scene!
Conversation/acObj/Line01443=The lava surge is back, viewers. Let's watch as the low ground is engulfed in molten rock and fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01444=Looks like the lava has fully receded. Can the commanders' workers make up for the lost time?
Conversation/acObj/Line01445=The lava has receded once more, leaving both crystals and destruction in its wake.
Conversation/acObj/Line01446=The lava surge is ending, viewers, but stay with us! I'm sure there's a lot more excitement to come!
Conversation/acObj/Line01447=It looks like that surge is finally over with. Let's watch the commanders get back to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01448=We're hearing that the lava is receding and the race to reactivate the stabilizer is back on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01449=It looks like the surge is over, for now. But when the burning tides rise again, we'll be there.
Conversation/acObj/Line01450=What's that rumbling? Four thousand degrees of molten death. Surging every few minutes, the lava is truly a force of nature.
Conversation/acObj/Line01451=Experts say lava surges occur every few minutes, obliterating anything in the way. That low ground is a dangerous place to be.
Conversation/acObj/Line01452=And it looks like the lava is already rising! Let's watch as the commanders below take refuge upon higher ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01453=I'm getting reports that the lava is surging now. Hopefully the low ground areas have already been cleared.
Conversation/acObj/Line01454=A commander's air support has taken a devastating hit from a lava spout. It's too much to watch! (aside)Of course, keep rolling!
Conversation/acObj/Line01455=A direct hit from a lava spout! Younger viewers may want to turn away!
Conversation/acObj/Line01456=We're still waiting for workers to collect a crystal and bring it to the stabilizer. Hopefully, things pick up soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01457=The timetable says workers should be collecting crystals by now. Makes you wonder, did Valerian choose the wrong allies?
Conversation/acObj/Line01460=I'm getting word that the environmental stabilizer is now at 25%. Which is still three quarters of a failure.
Conversation/acObj/Line01461=Even with the odds against them, workers have managed to reach 25% stability. A truly unexpected accomplishment.
Conversation/acObj/Line01462=This is Donny Vermillion reporting that the stabilizer has reached 50%. Workers are moving as fast as they can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01463=The environmental stabilizer has reached the halfway point. A big moment for the forces down below.
Conversation/acObj/Line01464=Only 25% remains 'til the stabilizer is charged. But is there enough time left?
Conversation/acObj/Line01465=Beyond all belief, the stabilizer is nearly charged! Can they make it? I'll be here to find out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01468=We're four minutes away from the planet's destruction... Keep watching UNN for constant coverage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01469=UNN Seismologist Terry estimates the planet has four minutes remaining. Let's see if you're right, Terry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01470=Only three minutes remain. Keep your eyes glued to the holo-screen. Anything could happen!
Conversation/acObj/Line01471=With three minutes remaining, you have to wonder what's going through the commanders' minds? Fear? Doubt? Likely both.
Conversation/acObj/Line01472=Updated reports indicate they've reached the two-minute mark. Hopefully they start working faster.
Conversation/acObj/Line01473=Terry, the counter shows two minutes left. Should we be getting out of orbit? We're fine? Okay, good.
Conversation/acObj/Line01474=We're down to the final minute. Keep watching the feed, as I'll be with you to the inevitable bitter end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01475=There's one minute left. One single... solitary... minute. (aside)Brought to you by UNN.
Conversation/acObj/Line01476=A Molten Salamander has emerged from the lava! Conservationists say they're endangered, but who's in danger now?
Conversation/acObj/Line01477=A Molten Salamander agitated by the lava is attacking the downtown area. We're going to see if we can get a closer shot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01478=The Salamander has resurfaced. I normally don't editorialize, but that thing looks angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01479=Flames spread as the Molten Salamander resurfaces. Will the Dominion's allies intervene, or leave this creature unchecked?
Conversation/acObj/Line01480=While Molten Sal is no more, its contributions to this fair city will never be forgotten.
Conversation/acObj/Line01481=Molten Sal was brutally slain by Dominion allies today, leaving many to wonder... who was the real fire-breathing monster?
Conversation/acObj/Line01482=Could the Emperor's allies have done more? The answer is yes. Thanks Valerian.
Conversation/acObj/Line01483=A devastating loss. This will surely haunt Emperor Valerian to the end of his reign.
Conversation/acObj/Line01484=Oh, watch this, viewers. The commanders are going to need to fly carefully to avoid the magma spouts bursting from the lava.
Conversation/acObj/Line01485=Looks like they're flying over the lava. That's a bold move with those lava spouts. (aside)They know about the lava spouts, right?
Conversation/acObj/Line01493=Oh, the horror... a worker has died before our very eyes. Hopefully another can carry on their work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01494=A commander just lost a worker, dropping their precious cargo. Can it be recovered? Or is all hope already lost?
Conversation/acObj/Line01495=If you're just joining us, a worker has been killed. Unfortunately, the Dominion military has yet to comment on the tragedy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01499=The lava is receding... and it's left behind some crystals. The commanders will be trying to gather those before the lava sweeps them away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01500=Looks like the receding lava has left behind crystals. For Veridia's sake, let's hope the workers gather those quickly.
Conversation/acObj/Line01501=It appears the receding lava has unearthed some crystals. With any luck, workers will get them to the stabilizer quickly.
Conversation/acObj/Line01502=A worker has been slain, and their cargo has fallen... a terrible loss. Oh, and the worker will be missed as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01503=A gruesome sight as a worker carrying a xenon crystal has died. Another unfortunate setback, surely to be felt by all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01504=More lava? Coming soon? I don't believe you. Admit it, you're desperate for attention, Terry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01505=Another lava surge has come! We'll have more after this short message from our sponsor.
Conversation/acObj/Line01506=I like to think the lava moves the crystals around. Terry says that's "unscientific." Don't listen to Terry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01507=Viewers, a commander's air units have just been hit by a lava spout, and I've got the footage. Let's replay it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01508=Breaking news. The enemy forces are attempting to stop the commanders' workers. We'll have more as the situation develops.
Conversation/acObj/Line01509=Are enemy forces about to attack the commanders' workers? Stay tuned to find out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01510=I'm getting word the enemy forces are attacking the commanders' workers. Let's watch as the battle erupts. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01511=The first crystal has been turned in, putting a little more time on what I'm calling "the countdown to destruction!"
Conversation/acObj/Line01512=As the workers turn in crystals, the stabilizer, uh, stabilizes... prolonging the coming doom by a few more moments.
Conversation/acObj/Line01513=Bringing a crystal to the stabilizer has bought them some time. But it will take more than time to heal this planet's wounds.
Conversation/acObj/Line01514=Commanders? Are you... are you real? Sorry, I've been here a while, and the terrazine... Not the best for my sanity! (Nervous laugh) ...It's not.
Conversation/acObj/Line01515=In case you ARE real, someone out there has been messing with my harvesting bots. Would you mind keeping an eye on them for me?
Conversation/acObj/Line01516=Hi, commanders! I thought everyone had forgotten about me out here. The hallucinations are the only visitors I've had.
Conversation/acObj/Line01517=I guess that's terrazine for you. Speaking of, someone's been destroying my harvesting bots. Could you provide an escort for them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01518=Welcome to the jungle, Commanders! Hope you like fun and games! Long term exposure to terrazine provides plenty of both! Trust me!
Conversation/acObj/Line01519=Someone out there is making a game of destroying my bots, though. They're ruining my research! I need you to guard those bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01520=Looks like a geyser's about to become active! One of my bots will depart for it shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line01521=The first geyser should be opening up soon. I'll send a bot out for it when it does.
Conversation/acObj/Line01522=Ooh, I've located a soon-to-be active geyser. Make sure to escort the bot I'll send to harvest it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01523=Bel'shir says that some more geysers are opening up soon. Don't worry if you can't hear her. She only talks to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01524=More geysers are gonna be active soon. Don't ask how I know that. I just... do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01525=Do you hear that? It's the terrazine moving beneath the surface. Ooh, more geysers are on the way.
Conversation/acObj/Line01526=Hmm, looks like there will be more geysers soon. You can always count on Bel'shir to provide what you need!
Conversation/acObj/Line01527=Seismic activity detected! That can only mean one thing: more geysers!
Conversation/acObj/Line01528=If I were a betting man, I'd put money on more geysers showing up soon. If, you know, I had any money.
Conversation/acObj/Line01529=Some geysers are gonna be opening in a few moments. My bots can smell them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01530=You know what I'm about to say, right, eh? That there are more geysers on the way? Get out of my head!
Conversation/acObj/Line01531=The geysers are returning, as foretold by omniscient Bel'shir! Be ready!
Conversation/acObj/Line01532=These are the last of the geysers! The last of their kind... all alone in the depths of space...
Conversation/acObj/Line01533=Looks like these are the last set of geysers. The end is nigh, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01534=These should be the last of the geysers! And things were just getting interesting.
Conversation/acObj/Line01535=Hey! Heads up! I'm sending out the first bot. Make sure to protect it! It's my favorite.
Conversation/acObj/Line01536=Okay, I'm sending a bot to collect the geyser's terrazine. Don't let it get destroyed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01537=My bot is departing now. It's fully automated, so all you have to do is keep it alive. Yes, it's alive. It's alive! Uh, sorry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01538=Bots are on their way, commanders! Please keep the little guys out of trouble.
Conversation/acObj/Line01539=Sending out the best of my bots! Well, the best of what's left, anyway.
Conversation/acObj/Line01540=My bots really want to get to the terrazine. They're kinda impatient, so I'm letting them out now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01541=Hey! The bots are leaving, and I didn't even get to pack them a refueling cell!
Conversation/acObj/Line01542=Bots away! (Laughs at his own joke) What? I thought it was funny. Bel'shir laughs every time I tell it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01543=I built these bots myself, in a cave, with a box of scraps! So I'd appreciate it if they came back intact.
Conversation/acObj/Line01544=I think the bots are telling me they're rolling out, but I could be wrong. They've lied to me before, those little miscreants!
Conversation/acObj/Line01545=There go the bots! (Sniffs) They grow up so fast! Daddy loves you!
Conversation/acObj/Line01546=My bot is collecting the terrazine now. You'll have to defend it until it's done.
Conversation/acObj/Line01547=Terrazine collection initiated! It might take a little while, so just sit tight!
Conversation/acObj/Line01548=Alright, collecting the terrazine now. Keep an eye out for trouble, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01549=Collection protocol initiated. Soon, all of Bel'shir's terrazine will be mine! Muhahaha!
Conversation/acObj/Line01550=Starting the collection process. Please be patient, this is a delicate procedure!
Conversation/acObj/Line01551=Oh benevolent Bel'shir, I humbly ask that you gift me with your terrazine. The commanders have promised to protect it. Right?
Conversation/acObj/Line01552=Gathering the terrazine now. Remember, commanders: Constant vigilance!
Conversation/acObj/Line01553=This terrazine is about to become TERRANzine. Bwahaha! What, nothing? Oh come on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01554=Harvest time! Let's see what our terrazine crop looks like this year.
Conversation/acObj/Line01555=My bots are taking in the terrazine. It has to be done just right, or else Bel'shir will be angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01556=Acquiring the terrazine now. Keep those bots safe, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01557=The harvesting bot is returning now. You'll have to continue guarding it until it arrives.
Conversation/acObj/Line01558=The bot is heading back. It's scared, so you should keep it company.
Conversation/acObj/Line01559=A successful terrazine harvest! Now that bot just has to make it home safely.
Conversation/acObj/Line01560=Come on home, little bots! The commanders will protect you!
Conversation/acObj/Line01561=Okay, the bots should be on their way back. I need that terrazine, commanders... for my... experiments.
Conversation/acObj/Line01562=The bots are returning to me now. I can always count on them to do that. Unlike SOME people.
Conversation/acObj/Line01563=Terrazine tank is full! My bots are making the return trip now. Don't let them get away from you!
Conversation/acObj/Line01564=And the race is on! Which bot will make it back to me first? (Whispers) My money's on Gary. He always gets the best oil.
Conversation/acObj/Line01565=Bots are heading home. They're sheep in need of a shepherd, commanders. And there are a lot of wolves on the prowl.
Conversation/acObj/Line01566=My bots are heading back to base. Be careful, commanders. It's a jungle out there!
Conversation/acObj/Line01567=Time for the bots to come back. I hate it when they're out there all night without giving me a call.
Conversation/acObj/Line01568=They're coming after my bots! Stop them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01569=Gah, here come the bad guys! Uh, who are they, again?
Conversation/acObj/Line01570=I'm picking up some hostile forces headed for my bots. They must really want that terrazine.
Conversation/acObj/Line01571=Look out, commanders! I'm detecting enemy movement toward the bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01572=The enemy clearly intends to attack my bots. Don't, don't, don't let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01573=Enemies are headed for my bots! What a bunch of jerks!
Conversation/acObj/Line01574=What's this? Enemy forces en route to my bots? It's just like Bel'shir said!
Conversation/acObj/Line01575=Oh, that's just great! The enemy is moving toward my bots. I knew I should have put more turrets on those things!
Conversation/acObj/Line01576=Hostile forces are advancing on my bots! Have they no respect for science!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01577=I see you, enemy scum! They're going to attack my bots, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01578=Oh man, they can warp in their forces right next to my bots? I guess I should have expected that from the protoss...
Conversation/acObj/Line01579=Oh commanders, the enemy is warping in near the bot! I wish I had that kind of tech...
Conversation/acObj/Line01580=They're warping in right next to the bot!? That is totally overpowered!
Conversation/acObj/Line01581=Incoming enemy drop pods! Which means... (gulps, whispers) They're ABOVE us. Protect the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01582=Enemy drop pods inbound on my bot! The sky is falling! The sky is falling!
Conversation/acObj/Line01583=They're dropping in right next to my bot! At least they're not smashing into it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01584=It's raining zerg! Death from above! Save the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01585=The zerg are dropping down right next to my bot! How many Leviathans do they have up there?
Conversation/acObj/Line01586=Incoming zerg drop pods! They're headed right for my bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01587=What IS that thing? It looks like a Void Thrasher! I didn't know they actually exist!
Conversation/acObj/Line01588=A Void Thrasher? Here? I thought those were purely theoretical!
Conversation/acObj/Line01589=No... it can't be... a Void Thrasher!? Please tell me this is another hallucination!
Conversation/acObj/Line01590=Umm, the Void Thrashers are back! They'll tear my bots apart if you don't stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01591=Oh by the way commanders, there seem to be more Void Thrashers around. Just keeping you informed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01592=Those Void Thrashers are the stuff of nightmares. Mine, specifically.
Conversation/acObj/Line01593=Oh wow, is that a hybrid? I haven't seen one in a while! Fascinating!
Conversation/acObj/Line01594=A hybrid! Does this mean the Dominion perfected the gene splicing tech to create them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01595=That... looks like a hybrid. From what I remember about them, that is very bad news.
Conversation/acObj/Line01596=More hybrid on the way. I'd really like a glimpse at their breeding facility's configuration.
Conversation/acObj/Line01597=These hybrid are different than the ones I've seen before. Any chance I could study them after this?
Conversation/acObj/Line01598=Hostile hybrid inbound! I wonder how terrazine affects their physiology...
Conversation/acObj/Line01599=Hey! Hey, they're attacking my bots! Commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01600=(Sing-song voice) My bots are under attack... My bots are under attack...
Conversation/acObj/Line01601=Good morning, commanders! The enemy's eating my bots for breakfast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01602=What's made to last forever and being destroyed? My bots, of course!
Conversation/acObj/Line01603=The enemy's attacking my bots! Geez, commanders, can't you keep a hold of aggro!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01604=Enemy forces have converged on my bots! Everybody, get in there!
Conversation/acObj/Line01605=Those guys are smashing my bots to pieces! And I really don't wanna pick up after them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01606=Please, please, please stop the enemy from breaking my stuff!
Conversation/acObj/Line01607=My bots are taking damage! Terrible, terrible damage!
Conversation/acObj/Line01608=They already destroyed one of the bots? I'll never get another one to that geyser in time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01611=The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01612=Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01618=Hey! I worked hard on that! I need those bots in order to harvest the terrazine, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01619=Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01620=Okay, that was my favorite bot! (Frustrated grunt) Please try to not lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01624=What's that noise? Oh, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01625=No, no, no! Not my bots! You monsters! We can't lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01626=Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots, commanders! They're all I have left!
Conversation/acObj/Line01627=That's a good little bot! Welcome home! I missed you so much!
Conversation/acObj/Line01628=The bots are back in town, the bots are back in town! (Makes guitar noises)
Conversation/acObj/Line01629=Look, commanders, bots! Oh, those are mine. (Gasps) And they have terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01630=Good news, commanders! My bots have brought me terrazine! Well, it's good news for me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01631=Hey uh, great job, commanders! My bots are safe and sound. Do you do this sort of thing often?
Conversation/acObj/Line01632=Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet this time, Bel'shir!
Conversation/acObj/Line01633=My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01634=We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But my research is going to require some more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01635=Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to finish my... uh... research, that's right!
Conversation/acObj/Line01636=I think I have a little less than half the terrazine I need. I guess I'll be sending out more bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01637=My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I should really send her a thank you card...
Conversation/acObj/Line01638=Are my terrazine tanks are half empty, or half full? Huh. This wouldn't be a problem if they were completely full!
Conversation/acObj/Line01639=Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Conversation/acObj/Line01640=I've got almost all the terrazine I need! Keep it up, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01641=Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line01642=Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! I need just a tiny bit more, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01643=Noooo! Now I'll never finish my research! Do you have any idea what I've been through on this planet!? Argh!
Conversation/acObj/Line01644=(Frustrated exertion) It's ruined! It's all ruined! Just like my graduate thesis project!
Conversation/acObj/Line01645=Yes! I can finally finish this research and get off this godforsaken rock! (Beat) I'm sorry, Bel'shir! I didn't mean it like that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01646=Research complete. Haha, that was pretty good! I crack me up. But seriously, let's get the hell out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01647=Nice work, commanders! You've done science a great service today. Now uhh... any chance I could get a ride off world?
Conversation/acObj/Line01648=Oh, what? They're siphoning the terrazine from Bel'shir's fauna! Commanders, try to free it if you can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01649=This is an outrage! The enemy is draining the terrazine from the Bel'shir gliders! We have to stop them! Or not, your choice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01650=They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic Bel'shir gliders! You... might want to stop them if you can, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01651=Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. You know what to do or not do, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01652=Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. Maybe we should put a stop to it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01653=Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. Do you think you have the time to set it free?
Conversation/acObj/Line01654=The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If you want to save it, you'll have to do it before it's completely drained.
Conversation/acObj/Line01655=Uh, we have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. Try not to forget about it. Being forgotten sucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01656=So, I'm not saying you have to, but if you want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, you don't have all day.
Conversation/acObj/Line01657=Once the Bel'shir glider's terrazine is gone, it'll be dead. So try to free it sooner than later. If you have a heart, that is.
Conversation/acObj/Line01658=(Mumbles calculations to himself)By my calculations, the Bel'shir glider is going to die soon. You don't have much time left to save it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01659=The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world, commanders. You'll miss your chance if you don't save it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01660=Well, you're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death, commanders. If you were ever planning on it, anyway.
Conversation/acObj/Line01661=The Bel'shir glider is almost dead, commanders. It's now or never. Literally. You could choose either one.
Conversation/acObj/Line01662=Wow, you really just let that thing die. And I thought I knew you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01663=Well, that's one dead whale. It was probably endangered, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01664=They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this...
Conversation/acObj/Line01665=All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! Tsk tsk. What a tragedy... just like my career.
Conversation/acObj/Line01666=You saved it! Bel'shir thanks you, commanders. I mean... I thank you. Yes. Me. With the thanking.
Conversation/acObj/Line01667=I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01668=Hey um, did you happen to save any of the extracted terrazine? No? Okay... well, that's okay...
Conversation/acObj/Line01669=You know, I never noticed those things floating around here before. I wonder where they came from.
Conversation/acObj/Line01670=Glad you're with us, Commanders. This planet is crawling with infested, and I need to get my people out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01671=Those things attack us whenever we spin up our engines. If you don't protect us while we launch, we'll never get off this rock.
Conversation/acObj/Line01672=This is Debra Greene, guildmaster of the local Kel-Morian mining crew. My people have to be evacuated as soon as possible.
Conversation/acObj/Line01673=Our ships can't start their launch sequences without attracting the infested. We need you to protect us until we're up in the air.
Conversation/acObj/Line01674=Everything's gone straight to hell, Commanders. This mining operation is over, and we need to leave right now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01675=But without your protection, the infested will tear us apart before we can even take off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01676=I'll send you the coordinates of our ships. If you set up a perimeter at one of them, its pilot will start the launch sequence.
Conversation/acObj/Line01677=Here are the locations of our ships. Each one of them will fire up its engines when you're in range to protect it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01678=We have several ships ready for launch. Head out to one of them when you're ready so that it can prepare for lift off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01679=Keep your guard up. You'll have to keep the infested at bay.
Conversation/acObj/Line01680=It won't be long before the noise draws the infested to your location.
Conversation/acObj/Line01681=Now listen, you need to hold off the infested until the ship's in the sky.
Conversation/acObj/Line01682=Engines are starting up. Get ready for the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01683=Starting the launch sequence. That's sure to get the infested's attention.
Conversation/acObj/Line01684=We're counting on you, commanders. Launch in progress.
Conversation/acObj/Line01685=Here we go. Keep the ship safe, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01686=Hold the line while the engines are warming up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01687=Can't thank you enough for this, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01688=That ship, and all of its passengers, are in your hands. Don't let them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01689=Incoming infested. Stop them from reaching the ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01690=Commanders, one of my pilots is getting antsy. I think he might try to launch without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01691=I've got a ship that can't wait any longer. They'll be taking off soon, with or without your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01692=My people don't have much time. They gotta launch soon, whether you're there or not.
Conversation/acObj/Line01693=That damn fool pilot's started the engines. Commanders, that ship won't make it on its own.
Conversation/acObj/Line01694=A ship's engines are firing up, and the infested are on their way. You have to help!
Conversation/acObj/Line01695=The ship's trying to launch without you. They can't get off the ground before the infested arrive!
Conversation/acObj/Line01696=People are panicking on one of the ships. I think its pilot's about to hit the launch button.
Conversation/acObj/Line01697=We've got a problem. One of the ships is getting ready to launch on its own.
Conversation/acObj/Line01698=One of the ships is desperate to go. Don't know how much longer I can convince them to wait.
Conversation/acObj/Line01699=A ship is going to make a run for it. It won't get far without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01700=Gotta get moving, commanders. People on that ship would rather die running than waiting.
Conversation/acObj/Line01701=Another ship is out of time. Its pilot has no choice but to launch soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01702=I'm detecting lots of infested headed for that ship. It has to get off the ground pronto.
Conversation/acObj/Line01703=There's a leak in that ship's fuel line. They have to launch real soon, or they won't have enough left to reach orbit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01704=Ship's starting to launch. Help them, before it's too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line01705=Here come the infested. Keep them off of that ship, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01706=That ship needs your help, commanders. It won't survive the infested without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01707=Engines are up and running. The infested are sure to follow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01708=You need to get to that ship before the infested rip it to pieces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01709=They've started the launch sequence. I know they're jumping the gun, but they still need your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01710=Time's up. That ship is going now, like it or not. They'll never make it alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01711=The infested are coming for that ship. It's up to you to stop them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01712=The infested have reached a ship. Stop them while there's still time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01713=That ship is taking damage from the infested, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01714=You've got to hold off the infested. Those monsters are already clawing through the hull!
Conversation/acObj/Line01715=Don't let the infested destroy the ship! My people's lives are at stake!
Conversation/acObj/Line01716=I got a ship calling for help. The infested are right on top of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01717=That ship's plating won't keep the infested out for long. You need to fight them off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01718=Those people are in danger, commanders. They will die without your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01719=The infested are attacking the ship. You have to do something, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01720=Gotta act fast, commanders. The infested have almost burrowed into that ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01721=The infested are getting close to destroying that ship. Make sure that they don't.
Conversation/acObj/Line01722=If the infested keep at it much longer, they'll rupture that ship's fuel line and blow it sky high.
Conversation/acObj/Line01723=You cannot allow the infested to continue attacking the ship. They'll kill everyone inside.
Conversation/acObj/Line01724=Commanders, that ship is in big trouble. You can't just let its passengers die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01725=The people aboard that ship are staring death in the face. Help them, please.
Conversation/acObj/Line01726=That ship's starting to break apart. You gotta get the infested off of it right away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01727=Won't be long before that ship is torn open. Kill the infested before that happens.
Conversation/acObj/Line01736=Ship's ready to go! Commanders, feel free to pull back from that launch point.
Conversation/acObj/Line01737=Okay, that ship's on its way out. Time to focus on the others.
Conversation/acObj/Line01738=That ship's getting out of here. No need to commit any more forces to it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01739=Evacuation in progress. We're in your debt, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01740=Engines to full, ship's in the sky. Those people get to live.
Conversation/acObj/Line01741=We have liftoff! At least some of us will survive this mess. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01742=We don't have a lot of time here. Move out and protect the ships so they can launch.
Conversation/acObj/Line01743=Daylight's burning. I have to get my people off this planet, and I need you to help me do it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01744=You need to defend those ships, commanders. There's no hope for them without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01745=Wait too long before heading out, and there might not be anyone left to save.
Conversation/acObj/Line01746=My people are depending on you. Don't keep them waiting.
Conversation/acObj/Line01747=My friends and family are on those ships. And they need your protection.
Conversation/acObj/Line01748=I promised my people they'd get home safe. I can't keep that promise without your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01749=Those are good people out there, commanders. Don't let them die alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01750=Sitting there, waiting to be killed... that's no way to go. Defend that ship, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01751=Don't abandon that ship, commanders. You're their only chance of survival.
Conversation/acObj/Line01752=Commanders, it's a huge risk to start more than one launch at a time. Please, do not let this backfire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01753=You're gambling with people's lives by trying to launch several ships at once. If you fail, they're the ones who lose.
Conversation/acObj/Line01754=Launching multiple ships is extremely dangerous. It gets us out of here faster, but the infested could overwhelm us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01755=Friends of yours? Didn't think so. They're getting ready to attack one of my ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01756=Looks like Amon himself wants us to die. Won't be long before his forces attack a ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01757=As if things couldn't get worse. It seems that Amon's preparing an attack against a ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01758=Another attack wave is about to head out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01759=Amon's forces are gathering for another attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01760=Gonna have some unwelcome guests real soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01761=Looks like the enemy army is about to attack us again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01762=I reckon the enemy's gonna come for us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01763=Seems like it's about time for another enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01764=I'm seeing an enemy attack on the horizon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01765=Amon's about to mobilize his forces. Get ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line01766=That enemy attack is on its way. Intercept it before it reaches the ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01767=Hostiles are heading directly for one of the ships. You have to stop them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01768=The infested are one thing, but Amon's forces are an even bigger threat. Take 'em out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01769=The enemy's making a beeline toward a ship. Don't let them reach it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01770=Heads up, commanders. We've got company coming.
Conversation/acObj/Line01771=They're heading for the ship again. You know what to do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01772=Here they come. That ship won't last long against them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01773=Incoming enemy attack. They're headed for one of the ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01774=Enemy's on the move. Gotta put a stop to them, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01775=The enemy just left their base. We don't have much time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01776=Amon's forces are inbound, and that ship is defenseless.
Conversation/acObj/Line01777=If Amon's forces reach the ship, they'll destroy it in no time. Do not let that happen.
Conversation/acObj/Line01778=That ship is a sitting duck, commanders. It won't survive an enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01779=Enemy's getting close to a ship. You're running out of time to stop 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line01780=You have to stop that enemy attack, commanders. They'll kill everyone on that ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01781=The enemy's painted a target on my people's back, and they're taking aim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01782=Don't forget about that enemy attack. It'll wipe out a ship much faster than the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01783=Amon's forces are closing the distance. They have to be stopped.
Conversation/acObj/Line01784=Won't be long before the enemy starts attacking the ship, and those people start to die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01785=The enemy's attacking the ship. You have to draw their attention away from it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01786=Amon's forces are destroying the ship. Those people are in danger!
Conversation/acObj/Line01787=A ship is under attack. Lives are depending on you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01788=The people on that ship will get killed if you don't stop that enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01789=If my people die to this attack, their blood will be on your hands.
Conversation/acObj/Line01790=That ship stands no chance against an enemy army. You have to intervene.
Conversation/acObj/Line01791=Can't waste any more time, commanders! That ship is getting hammered!
Conversation/acObj/Line01792=This ain't good. Amon's forces are gonna smash that ship to pieces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01793=Don't know why these guys want us dead, but I'm glad you're here to defend us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01794=Well, that's one fewer disaster to worry about. Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01795=Nice work. Now we can focus on the infested again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01796=That bought that ship a little more time. It might make all the difference.
Conversation/acObj/Line01797=People on that ship are cheering for you. Hell, so am I.
Conversation/acObj/Line01798=You just saved a lot of lives, commanders. We owe you big.
Conversation/acObj/Line01799=Hopefully, Amon'll think twice before trying that again. But I doubt it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01800=We just might get out of here alive, after all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01801=I'll be damned... the infested just took out Amon's forces. Enemy of my enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01802=As far as I'm concerned, Amon's forces and the infested can go right on killing each other.
Conversation/acObj/Line01803=I guess not even Amon's army can ignore the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01804=Never thought I'd thank the infested for anything. But they sure took care of that enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01805=The infested just destroyed Amon's attack force. And I thought they were dangerous before...
Conversation/acObj/Line01806=I promised those people I'd get them home safe... We have to protect the others.
Conversation/acObj/Line01807=They're gone... just like that. We can't let the same happen to the rest of the ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01808=Grief has to wait. The other ships must be defended at all costs.
Conversation/acObj/Line01809=No, not again! We barely have enough ships as it is!
Conversation/acObj/Line01810=Damn it, no! If we lose too many ships, we'll have no way to evacuate.
Conversation/acObj/Line01811=So many dead... If we keep losing ships, there's no way we'll survive.
Conversation/acObj/Line01812=We can't afford to lose any more ships! Don't let us die out here, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01813=These... these are the last of our ships. We lose another, and we're done for.
Conversation/acObj/Line01814=Just one more ship lost, and there won't be enough left to save the survivors.
Conversation/acObj/Line01815=We're off to a good start. Keep it up, and we'll get everyone safely evacuated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01816=A fair number of my people have made it to orbit, but we've still got a ways to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01817=That ship's safe now, but there are several more that need your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01818=The people on that ship owe you their lives. But there are still a few more to get up in the air.
Conversation/acObj/Line01819=Evacuation efforts are going well, commanders. Just gotta keep protecting those ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01820=I'd say roughly half of my crew still needs evac. We're counting on you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01821=Just a few of my people are left on the planet. We're almost there!
Conversation/acObj/Line01822=That's almost everyone. Got a few more to evacuate, then we can all get out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01823=Keep holding the line, commanders. Evacuation is almost complete.
Conversation/acObj/Line01824=We call that thing Blightbringer. Meanest zerg I've ever seen. Might wanna take it out if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01825=That's Blightbringer. Killed a lot of us when the infestation started. Return the favor, if you get the chance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01826=Think the infested are bad? Blightbringer puts 'em to shame. Kill it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01827=Blightbringer won't stay above ground forever. If you're gonna kill it, you should do it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01828=Not sure if you wanna deal with Blightbringer, but it looks like it wants to scurry away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01829=I think Blightbringer is gonna burrow into the ground. If you wanna squash it, do it fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line01830=Blightbringer's made its escape. Makes me nervous knowing it's somewhere out there.
Conversation/acObj/Line01831=You didn't get around to killing Blightbringer? Don't worry about it. I'd rather we both live than die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01832=Looks like Blightbringer's gone. It can have this damn planet for all I care.
Conversation/acObj/Line01833=Blightbringer's dead. And good riddance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01834=Won't bring back the people it killed, but thank you for at least giving them justice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01835=Thank you for that, commanders. We just didn't have the firepower to deal with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01836=The KMC supplied us with Eradicators, but they've gone haywire. If you could deal with them for us, I'd appreciate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01837=Our Eradicators started malfunctioning as the infestation began. Think you'll have time to destroy them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01838=Those Eradicators are out of control. They could be dangerous. If you can, try to break them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01839=If the Eradicators reenter the facility, you won't be able to reach them. You gotta move it if you want to hit them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01840=The Eradicators are about to return to the facility. If you're going to handle them, do it sooner than later.
Conversation/acObj/Line01841=You can't attack the Eradicators after they're back in the facility. Hurry up if you want to destroy 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line01842=The Eradicators have gone back inside the facility. Really hope they don't blow up the planet or anything.
Conversation/acObj/Line01843=Just saw the Eradicators retreat to the facility. Forget about them, they're not a threat anymore.
Conversation/acObj/Line01844=Eradicators are gone. Maybe if we're lucky, they'll incinerate everything after the evacuation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01845=Eradicators are down. Thank you, commanders. No telling what those things were going to do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01846=Never did trust those things. That's what you get when the KMC tries to copy Umojan tech.
Conversation/acObj/Line01847=You've busted up the Eradicators. Damn things did squat to protect us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01848=That was it. That was our last hope. We're dead, commanders. All of us are dead.
Conversation/acObj/Line01849=People in the ships were lucky. They died quick. But the rest of us...
Conversation/acObj/Line01850=That's the last of us. I can't thank you enough, commanders. You've saved us all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01851=Alright, that's everyone. Let's get on out of here! Thank you, commanders. For everything.
Conversation/acObj/Line01852=Evacuation's complete! We went through hell down there, commanders. Thank you for getting us out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01853=We... must... feed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01854=You'll never take me alive, you bastards!
Conversation/acObj/Line01855=Intruder detected!
Conversation/acObj/Line01856=Exterminate! Exterminate!
Conversation/acObj/Line01857=Listen up, commanders. We've got a serious level of infestation here, and we need to burn it out STAT.
Conversation/acObj/Line01858=These monsters are dangerous at night, but they burn up during the day. That's when we'll torch the infested structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01859=Finally, some back up! Look, I need to get rid of this infestation before it spreads to the rest of the planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01860=The infested come out at night, but they can't survive the daylight. Use that time to take out their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01861=This planet is in serious trouble. If this infestation spreads, there won't be any survivors. We need to stop it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01862=It's risky to move at night, but the infested die off during the day. When the sun is up, move out and burn their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01863=Heads up, commanders. The day's almost over, which means the infested are gonna come for us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01864=We're almost out of daylight. Once the sun sets, the infested will come knocking on our door.
Conversation/acObj/Line01865=Night's almost here. I'd start getting ready to deal with the infested if I were you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01866=Looks like the sun's about to set. Get ready for nightfall.
Conversation/acObj/Line01867=Don't go out too far. There isn't much time left in the day.
Conversation/acObj/Line01868=The day's going to end soon, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01869=Another day's coming to an end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01870=Make the most of the day, commanders. It's nearly over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01871=It's almost nighttime. Be ready for the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01872=Time is running out. Don't forget that our base will need to be defended at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01873=It's nighttime, commanders! Fight off the infested until daybreak!
Conversation/acObj/Line01874=That's the last of the sunlight. Our defenses have to hold until the night is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01875=The sun is down! Defend against the infested until it rises again!
Conversation/acObj/Line01876=We're in for a rough night, but I know we can survive it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01877=Sit tight, commanders. This night's just getting started. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01878=Another night, another fight. Keep them out of our base!
Conversation/acObj/Line01879=A lot of dead out there. Make sure that we don't join them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01880=I knew the infestation was bad, but this is crazy! Hold them off!
Conversation/acObj/Line01881=Just keep fighting, commanders. We'll make it through the night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01882=Here come the infested. We have to hold them off until sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01883=The sun will rise any minute now. Then the infested will burn away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01884=Just a little longer, commanders. The infested can't survive in the sun.
Conversation/acObj/Line01885=The night's almost over. We'll be safe to move out again in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01886=We can do this, commanders. It's almost sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01887=Keep it up! Night's coming to an end soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01888=The infested can attack us all they want. Soon, it's gonna be our turn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01889=This may look bad, but it won't last much longer. Morning's almost here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01890=Daybreak is just around the corner. Hold the line until then!
Conversation/acObj/Line01891=Don't give up, commanders. This nightmare is about to end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01892=It won't be long now. We just have to survive until dawn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01893=You sure you want to do that at night, commanders? The infested will be here any minute!
Conversation/acObj/Line01894=I like the hustle, but I'd advise against it, commanders. It'll be easier to take out the structures in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01895=Don't get too bold out there. If our base falls to the infested, this planet will be lost.
Conversation/acObj/Line01896=Sending you the coordinates for more structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01897=I've got another sector with structures on my scanners.
Conversation/acObj/Line01898=We're not done yet, commanders. Here are some more structures to burn out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01899=Looks like we can find additional structures here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01900=Detecting more structures at this location.
Conversation/acObj/Line01901=Ugh. Amon. Great. Looks like we have to fight through his forces to get to the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01902=Amon's forces are trying to keep us away from the structures. Don't let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01903=I'm picking up hostile forces headed for the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01904=So we have to fight Amon's forces AND the infested? This just keeps getting better...
Conversation/acObj/Line01905=I can't believe Amon's forces are trying to protect those structures. Take them out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01906=Look out for those hunterlings. They're fast, and boy can they JUMP.
Conversation/acObj/Line01907=Incoming hunterlings! They're cliff jumpers, so watch out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01908=Hunterlings! Those things move fast, and they can jump up cliffs!
Conversation/acObj/Line01909=We call these ones "kaboomers." They spit acid, and they explode when they die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01910=Keep your distance from those kaboomers. We call them that for a reason, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01911=The marines named these ones "kaboomers." The acid spit is bad enough, but just wait until they explode.
Conversation/acObj/Line01912=Chokers. They'll pull in your forces and stun them if they aren't dealt with.
Conversation/acObj/Line01913=Those chokers are bad news. They'll pull in their prey and stun them with their toxins.
Conversation/acObj/Line01914=Beware of those chokers. They'll stun and kill your forces after pulling them in.
Conversation/acObj/Line01915=Spotters are in the air. Shoot them down before they become a problem.
Conversation/acObj/Line01916=Detecting some spotters. They can fly, so you better keep an eye on them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01917=The infested have spotters in the sky. You should probably deal with them soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01918=A stank!? Those things are resistant to sunlight! We have to be the ones to kill it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01919=That stank is strong enough to withstand sunlight. We have to kill it ourselves.
Conversation/acObj/Line01920=Oh no, not a stank! If we don't kill it, it'll keep attacking us even after sunrise!
Conversation/acObj/Line01921=One of our barricades is being hit hard.
Conversation/acObj/Line01922=The infested are trying to break through one of our barricades.
Conversation/acObj/Line01923=A barricade is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line01924=We've got a barricade taking some damage here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01925=I'm seeing the infested gather at one of the barricades.
Conversation/acObj/Line01926=Looks like they're trying to tear down a barricade.
Conversation/acObj/Line01927=You'll have to defend that barricade if it's going to stay standing.
Conversation/acObj/Line01928=Commanders, that barricade won't hold up for much longer.
Conversation/acObj/Line01929=Uh, we might have a problem with that barricade pretty soon here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01930=One of our barricades is nearly destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01931=The infested are about to take down that barricade!
Conversation/acObj/Line01932=Keep the infested off that barricade, or it's going to fall!
Conversation/acObj/Line01933=We've lost a barricade! Get some defenses in place or the infested will walk right in!
Conversation/acObj/Line01934=There goes a barricade... We're going to need more defenses at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01935=Commanders! The infested have broken through a barricade! We have to stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01936=A barricade's been destroyed! Without additional defenses, our base will be crawling with infested!
Conversation/acObj/Line01937=The infested have brought down a barricade. We have to put up more defenses or we're in big trouble!
Conversation/acObj/Line01938=Okay, commanders. We need to destroy enough structures today to stay ahead of the infestation. I've already marked a few for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01939=We made it to the dawn. To stop the infestation, we need to destroy enough of it each day. Head to these coordinates to start.
Conversation/acObj/Line01940=Time to get to work. We have to burn away enough of the infestation before the day ends. Start with the structures I've marked.
Conversation/acObj/Line01941=Looks like we survived another night. I've updated the number of structures we need to destroy today to stay on track.
Conversation/acObj/Line01942=Let's get to work, commanders. We have to burn enough of the infestation today so that we don't fall behind.
Conversation/acObj/Line01943=Sunrise, that's our cue to move. We won't have enough time later if we destroy too few structures today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01944=Good morning, commanders. We've got two days left, and our work is definitely cut out for us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01945=We have two more days to stop the infestation. Let's make them count.
Conversation/acObj/Line01946=Boy, the days go by fast on this planet. We have two more to burn away the infestation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01947=Let's do this, commanders! Finish off the infestation today, or this planet is toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01948=We've come this far, and now it's time to end it. Take out the last of the infestation before the day is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01949=It's now or never, commanders. The people on this planet are counting on us. Burn all the infestation that's left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01950=We're making good progress, but there's still a lot of infestation to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01951=It looks like we've taken out a good amount of infestation. Just need to keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01952=There's still a lot of infestation left, but we'll get every last bit of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01953=We're halfway there, commanders. Keep it up and we can still save this planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01954=About half of the infestation has been cleared out. Don't give up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01955=My scans show that half of the infestation is gone. We can do this.
Conversation/acObj/Line01956=Most of the infestation has been dealt with. Just a little more to go!
Conversation/acObj/Line01957=The infestation is almost gone. But we need to get the rest of it for this to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01958=We've burned out almost all of the infestation. Let's finish the job.
Conversation/acObj/Line01959=I'm detecting a virophage in the field. Killing it could prevent future infestations, but we'll have to attack it at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01960=Looks like there's a virophage among the infested. Might be a good idea to kill it, but we can only do that at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01961=There's a virophage out there, commanders. Kill it if you can, but you'll have to do it at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01962=You have until sunrise to attack the virophage. If you can't kill it now, you can come back to it tomorrow night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01963=That virophage will burrow once the sun is up. It may take you more than one night to kill it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01964=Don't worry if you can't kill the virophage tonight. I'm sure it'll be back tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01965=Nice job, commanders. Now we don't have to worry about the virophage after we clear out the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01966=You just saved me a lot of trouble, commanders. I was going to send a crew to exterminate that thing after this mission.
Conversation/acObj/Line01967=Well, that's one less headache to worry about on this planet. Thanks, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01968=Damn, there's just too much of it! We have to get as many people off this planet as we can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01969=There's no stopping the infestation now. This planet's gone, commanders. And a lot of people with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01970=That's the last of it! The planet's saved, commanders! And we have you to thank.
Conversation/acObj/Line01971=I can't believe it! We actually did it! I mean, of course we did it. Never had a doubt.
Conversation/acObj/Line01972=Haven't seen a situation that hairy since I was in the UED. Thanks for getting us through it, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01973=What, now those special infested are cloaked? Great, just what we needed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01974=Stay alert! Some of those special infested can cloak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01975=Looks like the special infested can cloak. Hope you're ready for this. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01976=Nice work, commanders! The more we torch today, the fewer we have to deal with tomorrow!
Conversation/acObj/Line01977=I see you were the right ones to call. At this rate, we'll have fewer structures to destroy tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01978=We've burned enough structures today, so tomorrow should be a little easier on us. Just a little.
Conversation/acObj/Line01979=Glad to be teamed up with fellow overachievers. We'll be less crunched for time tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01980=I have to say, I'm impressed. I'll revise the estimate for tomorrow based on what you've done today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01981=There's not much time left. Destroy enough of the structures today, or the infestation will grow out of control!
Conversation/acObj/Line01982=The sun's about to set! Torch those structures before it's too late!
Conversation/acObj/Line01983=We have to pick up the pace! Time is running out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01984=If we don't destroy more structures before sundown, this whole planet will be lost!
Conversation/acObj/Line01985=Come on, commanders. We don't have much more time to destroy those structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01986=Cutting it real close, here. Those structures need to burn before nightfall!
Conversation/acObj/Line01987=We're running out of daylight, and there are still more structures to burn!
Conversation/acObj/Line01988=Way to go! This infestation will be burned away in no time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01989=Whew! That's at least enough for today. But feel free to take out more of them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01990=Ugh, Amon's supporting the infested with his own forces. It's gonna be a long night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01991=Are you kidding me? Amon wants to attack us now, too? Perfect.
Conversation/acObj/Line01992=Looks like Amon wants a piece of us, too. Get those defenses in place!
Conversation/acObj/Line01993=Virophages are especially dangerous to air units. Proceed with caution.
Conversation/acObj/Line01994=Watch out, that virophage can make quick work of your air units.
Conversation/acObj/Line01995=Don't let that virophage take out too many of your air units, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01996=You have driven Amon from this world, and saved all who dwell here! Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01997=It is done! You have earned the gratitude of all Nerazim, commanders. We will honor your deeds forever.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=The Voidshade hybrid is dead, and Amon's forces vanquished! We will rebuild this city, and undo what his minions have wrought.
Conversation/acObj/Line01999=Amon's new servant lives... It is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=We did all we could... but this battle has ended.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=And so the end comes...
Conversation/acObj/Line02002=Matriarch Vorazun sent me to investigate this world. Amon is using energies from the temple to awaken a Voidshade hybrid...
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=Matriarch, I have investigated Amon's presence on this world just as you ordered. He is using the temple's energies to create a Voidshade hybrid.
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=This is unlike any foe I have seen! Destroy the Void Slivers before it is complete.
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=Amon's servants have desecrated these temple grounds to empower a Voidshade hybrid. If it succeeds, it could destroy us all.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=You must strike down the Void Slivers to prevent its awakening!
Conversation/acObj/Line02007=When scouting this world, I discovered that Amon's forces have invaded the temple to raise a Voidshade hybrid.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=You cannot let him succeed. Eliminate his Void Slivers, and the abomination will not draw breath.
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=The Voidshade hybrid will awaken soon unless you destroy a sliver!
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=We must strike a Void Sliver! The hybrid has almost formed. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=The hybrid has drawn most of the power from the temple. Shatter a Void Sliver!
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=Act now, or we are lost!
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=We are on the edge of ruin, my friends! Fight with all you have!
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=We haven't a moment to spare. The hybrid is rising!
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=One sliver is down... You have bought yourselves time, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=The first Void Sliver is no more, but many remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=You have crushed a Void Sliver! I knew you could be trusted.
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=Two Void Slivers have been annihilated. Good.
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=Ah, you have destroyed another sliver. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=A second sliver ends in ruin--as it should.
Conversation/acObj/Line02021=Over half of the slivers are gone now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02022=Amon will notice his slivers disappearing if you keep this up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02023=Excellent. Each felled Void Sliver gives us more time.
Conversation/acObj/Line02024=Another sliver is gone. You are turning the tide, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02025=Only one sliver remains, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02026=Yes! Destroy the last Void Sliver, and the hybrid shall die!
Conversation/acObj/Line02027=The people of this world have been trapped here since the battle began. We must ensure they depart soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02028=If you can help defend the ship when it leaves, I will not forget it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02029=Many protoss inhabit this world. Their lives are in danger as long as they remain here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02030=Please try to protect the evacuation ship after it departs.
Conversation/acObj/Line02031=I must ask another favor of you, friends. We are trying to evacuate the people of this city.
Conversation/acObj/Line02032=The ship leaves soon, and it could use any defenses you have to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line02033=The evacuation ship is heading out. Keep watch over it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02034=The evacuation vessel is moving forward. I pray it remains safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02035=Be on your guard. The evacuation ship is underway.
Conversation/acObj/Line02036=The ship will stop here to pick up more survivors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02037=Well done. Our vessel can warp more passengers aboard from here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02038=At last! We can evacuate everyone in this area now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02039=Make your preparations. The evacuation will resume soon. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02040=I must warn you--the ship will be leaving shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02041=The evacuation ship is almost ready to resume its course. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02042=A vessel was destroyed, but there is still hope. I will ready a replacement.
Conversation/acObj/Line02043=Our enemies have brought down a ship. We will try to send another soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02044=This ship has fallen... Do not let them succeed against the next one.
Conversation/acObj/Line02045=Alas... there are no remaining ships. This bodes ill for the survivors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02046=Our evacuation has failed, but at least we made a valiant attempt.
Conversation/acObj/Line02047=That was the last ship. I grieve for those we have left behind.
Conversation/acObj/Line02048=Against all odds, we have saved every survivor in the city. Well done, my friends.
Conversation/acObj/Line02049=The evacuations are complete. I shall rest easy knowing all are safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02050=We have done it! The evacuation was a success. My thanks to you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02051=This Purifier facility once converted warriors' personalities into AI. But it was shut down after complications with a Tal'darim prisoner.
Conversation/acObj/Line02052=His AI infected many of our systems, and I will need your assistance to purge them.
Conversation/acObj/Line02053=During the height of the Purifier program, many personalities were stored here for AI conversion. One of them turned out to be more than we could handle.
Conversation/acObj/Line02054=This Tal'darim, once a prisoner, has escaped and corrupted our systems to create his own forces. You must help me restore our control.
Conversation/acObj/Line02055=Purifiers were born here, converted from the personalities of great warriors. But one of them was merely a prisoner. A Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line02056=His AI personality managed to infiltrate our systems and turn them against us. I can undo the damage, but I will need your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line02057=Accessing security terminal and beginning data reset. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02058=Restoring original security protocol. Try to be patient.
Conversation/acObj/Line02059=Beginning security data restoration. Considerable wait time ahead.
Conversation/acObj/Line02060=Analyzing corrupted security data. Stand by.
Conversation/acObj/Line02061=Initiating security system rebuild. This will take a while.
Conversation/acObj/Line02062=I require aid. System defenses have been activated against me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02063=The Tal'darim still thinks he can destroy me. Can you prove him wrong?
Conversation/acObj/Line02064=Hostile forces have been deployed to my position.
Conversation/acObj/Line02065=System takeover is halfway complete. And yes, I am doing my best.
Conversation/acObj/Line02066=I have regained control of 50% of our systems, but it hasn't been easy.
Conversation/acObj/Line02067=Restoration efforts have reached the halfway point.
Conversation/acObj/Line02068=My work here is nearly finished, if you can believe it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02069=Only 25% of the corruption remains. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02070=I have overwritten three-quarters of the Tal'darim's alterations. Hold fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line02071=I have restored this location, but there are still other security terminals remaining.
Conversation/acObj/Line02072=The first location is secure. Unfortunately, the Tal'darim was quite thorough. I'll need to visit the other security terminals to purge them.
Conversation/acObj/Line02073=Initial security terminal is clear. Fear not, there are several more.
Conversation/acObj/Line02074=System integrity verified. We are back online at this location.
Conversation/acObj/Line02075=Data secure. This security terminal is clear of corruption.
Conversation/acObj/Line02076=Despite the odds, everything has been fully reset here. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02077=The enemy has raised a suppression tower. Their beams will interfere with my work unless you destroy them. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02078=The facility's suppression towers used to protect us. But now, this one will bring my efforts to a halt if you do not stop it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02079=This suppression tower was once a useful defense. Now it is in the way of my work. Kindly dispose of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02080=Detecting another suppression tower.
Conversation/acObj/Line02081=I recommend taking out that suppression tower. Quickly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02082=Enemy suppression tower activated. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02083=Multiple suppression towers are readying attacks. Intervention is necessary.
Conversation/acObj/Line02084=Suppression towers are powering up in several locations.
Conversation/acObj/Line02085=Numerous suppression towers activating... (sarcastic) Just what we needed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02086=Tower destroyed. Good work. I will have to ask for more of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02087=The tower has ceased its fire. At least something is going right.
Conversation/acObj/Line02088=Suppression tower down. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02089=Tower attacks have temporarily disabled my systems.
Conversation/acObj/Line02090=I am unable to progress due to the tower's interruption.
Conversation/acObj/Line02091=Systems work halted by tower strikes.
Conversation/acObj/Line02092=I must proceed to the next security terminal soon. Make your preparations.
Conversation/acObj/Line02093=Nothing more to do here. I shall move on to the next area in a moment.
Conversation/acObj/Line02094=Warning--I will set out for the next location shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02095=I am about to head to the third terminal.
Conversation/acObj/Line02096=The transport is nearly ready. Relocating to the third terminal soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02097=Plotting a course to the final terminal. I will depart soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02098=Finalizing route to final terminal. Try to stay focused.
Conversation/acObj/Line02099=Transport en route.
Conversation/acObj/Line02100=Moving forward.
Conversation/acObj/Line02101=The transport is in motion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02102=Proceeding.
Conversation/acObj/Line02103=Advancing toward the next terminal now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02104=Transport damaged. I must pause my efforts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02105=I am under attack. Care to assist?
Conversation/acObj/Line02106=This is just a transport. It has no shields to defend me from these strikes!
Conversation/acObj/Line02107=Transport systems are near failure!
Conversation/acObj/Line02108=The enemy is breaking apart my transport!
Conversation/acObj/Line02109=My transport is nearly in ruins!
Conversation/acObj/Line02110=Interesting. One of the data cores has not yet been breached by the rogue Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line02112=Though the Tal'darim has been relentless, he has not yet gained access to this data core.
Conversation/acObj/Line02113=That Tal'darim is vindictive and will stop at nothing to invade every last one of our data cores.
Conversation/acObj/Line02114=I had nearly lost hope for this data core, but it's still possible to retrieve the personalities within it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02115=There are more personalities in the data core here. Try to reach them before the enemy does.
Conversation/acObj/Line02116=More of our Purifier kin are being stored in this data core. Recover them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line02117=The data core... has been corrupted. There were no backups for the personalities within...
Conversation/acObj/Line02118=The Tal'darim has gained control of the data core. I fear for the personalities it held.
Conversation/acObj/Line02119=Data core lost. I grieve for those who passed with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02120=The Tal'darim destroyed our data core. He never possessed any honor, even in the flesh.
Conversation/acObj/Line02121=Excellent! We have saved the Purifier personalities from this data core.
Conversation/acObj/Line02123=Thanks to your diligence, the personalities of these warriors are safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02124=Fortunately, all of the personalities from the data cores were preserved.
Conversation/acObj/Line02125=The Tal'darim is brutal, but not clever. He has not discovered this data core yet, but we only have a little time remaining.
Conversation/acObj/Line02126=We can only move in secrecy for a little longer. The Tal'darim will find the data core soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02127=The enemy is targeting our data core. You must hurry.
Conversation/acObj/Line02128=Tal'darim signature detected. He's found the data core! Be swift.
Conversation/acObj/Line02129=The data core is under siege.
Conversation/acObj/Line02130=The enemy strikes our data core!
Conversation/acObj/Line02131=A data core is in danger. Action advised.
Conversation/acObj/Line02132=Security protocol failing. We have lost the facility! I shudder to think of what the rogue Tal'darim will do with it...
Conversation/acObj/Line02133=I was unable to act in time. This is the end for the facility, and all the uncorrupted personalities that remain here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02134=The rogue Tal'darim has expanded his control beyond any hope of reversal. We must abandon the facility.
Conversation/acObj/Line02135=Analyzing systems... No trace of the Tal'darim personality remains. It appears he is truly dead, at last. Fine work, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02136=The rogue personality has been eliminated from this facility. The Purifiers give you our thanks, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02137=All systems are under our control. And do not fret--we will never attempt to convert another Tal'darim warrior.
Conversation/acObj/Line02138=This one contains three personalities. Save them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line02139= If you have time, please rescue the personalities within it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02140=If you could recover these personalities, the Purifiers would be grateful.
Conversation/acObj/Line02141=The Tal'darim's forces are heading our way. They appear as holographic warriors of many races--inspired by his battles in life. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02142=Stay vigilant. The Tal'darim sends his holographic warriors to your position. They may not be flesh, but they are fierce.
Conversation/acObj/Line02143=The Tal'darim has altered the holographic security forces to resemble warriors he fought when he was still alive.
Conversation/acObj/Line02146=What a relief! Another personality saved...
Conversation/acObj/Line02147=You have protected another of my brethren.
Conversation/acObj/Line02148=This personality will never be lost now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02149=This Purifier is free from harm.
Conversation/acObj/Line02150=Moebius Corps once had ties to our own emperor, Valerian Mengsk. Now they're raising hybrid to kill everyone in the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02151=I found a mech here, the Balius, that can destroy the hybrid. But first it needs parts. It's in your best interest to help me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02152=A deplorable tragedy has occurred here. Moebius Corps took over the research facility and used it to create their monstrosities. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02153=I can take them down using their own prototype mech, the Balius. Gather parts so that we can activate it, and be quick about it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02154=The emperor said that Moebius Corps is using this facility to breed alien terrors. The Dominion must exterminate them at all costs!
Conversation/acObj/Line02155=I'll have to use a mech, the Balius, to get through the hybrid's cell shields. Once you collect the parts, I'll get started.
Conversation/acObj/Line02156=We've passed the halfway point. The Balius is coming together.
Conversation/acObj/Line02157=The Balius is halfway online. Keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02158=We have half of the Balius parts now. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02159=Balius construction has nearly concluded. A small number of parts remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line02160=The Balius is almost ready, now. Just a few more parts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02161=We're only a handful of parts away from rolling out.
Conversation/acObj/Line02162=You are efficient, aren't you? We're set for parts now. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02163=Well, would you look at that! We have enough parts for launch!
Conversation/acObj/Line02164=Construction material needs have been met. Your cooperation is appreciated.
Conversation/acObj/Line02165=The Balius took significant damage in that encounter. I'm gonna need more parts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02166=I'm afraid the Balius requires additional parts after that fight.
Conversation/acObj/Line02167=The Balius got beat up back there. Go gather some more parts for it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02168=Evaluating pre-launch diagnostics. This will only take a bit.
Conversation/acObj/Line02169=Combat systems are up and running. Safety tests still pending--so be patient.
Conversation/acObj/Line02170=I'm making the final preparations for the Balius' deployment. Expect to see me out there soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02171=Ready for action! I'm approaching the hybrid's containment cell.
Conversation/acObj/Line02172=This is General Davis reporting in. The Balius is en route to its target.
Conversation/acObj/Line02173=Hybrid cell identified. The Balius is headed to it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02174=I've suffered a major breach here, but I can make one final salvo.
Conversation/acObj/Line02175=Structural integrity has been compromised. This will be my last hit for now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02176=I can do one more strike, then the Balius needs to be patched up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02177=Only a technician can fix the mech now. You're on your own.
Conversation/acObj/Line02178=I'm returning for repairs now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02179=Heading back to the mechanics.
Conversation/acObj/Line02180=Containment cell down. Focus on the hybrid!
Conversation/acObj/Line02181=I've cracked the containment cell! Hybrid target acquired!
Conversation/acObj/Line02182=Cell ruptured. Open fire on the hybrid!
Conversation/acObj/Line02183=There's a mechanical failure on the Balius. Finish the hybrid without me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02184=I have to fall back for repairs. Kill the hybrid, no matter what happens.
Conversation/acObj/Line02185=The Balius can't take any more of this. I'll leave the hybrid to you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02186=I didn't think you could pull that off alone, but I'm glad to be wrong.
Conversation/acObj/Line02187=You did it, commanders. This hybrid threat has been annihilated.
Conversation/acObj/Line02188=What a relief! Nothing like a dead hybrid to calm the nerves.
Conversation/acObj/Line02189=Target down. Now I need to get the Balius back in fighting shape.
Conversation/acObj/Line02190=That hybrid's dead, but it almost took the Balius with it. I'll need to spend some time restoring it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02191=Our victory came at a price, commanders. The Balius is going to need more work.
Conversation/acObj/Line02192=All shall SUBMIT.
Conversation/acObj/Line02193=DIE.
Conversation/acObj/Line02194=Only darkness awaits you...
Conversation/acObj/Line02195=I have new intel. Moebius Corps is attempting to evacuate key research material while we're distracted with the hybrid.
Conversation/acObj/Line02196=Find their train and destroy it. That's an order.
Conversation/acObj/Line02197=Moebius Corps just doesn't give up! They're still trying to save their research, even as we gun down their prized experiments.
Conversation/acObj/Line02198=Ensure their train never reaches its destination, would you?
Conversation/acObj/Line02199=I've never seen anything like Moebius Corps. We're ruining their facility, and they're still trying to smuggle their research out!
Conversation/acObj/Line02200=You'll find them on a train running across the research area. Leave none alive.
Conversation/acObj/Line02201=They're sending a second train. Intercept it!
Conversation/acObj/Line02202=My reports indicate a second train is coming.
Conversation/acObj/Line02203=Another train will pass us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02204=Do not let the train through!
Conversation/acObj/Line02205=Everyone on this train must die!
Conversation/acObj/Line02206=Launch an assault on the train!
Conversation/acObj/Line02207=Excellent. The train is wrecked, and Moebius will never get what was on it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02208=There's something about seeing Moebius trains crash and burn that is just so satisfying.
Conversation/acObj/Line02209=The train crashed, and I'm not seeing any survivors on my scans. Moebius can rot with all the evil it has perpetrated.
Conversation/acObj/Line02210=This train has nearly escaped! Pay attention!
Conversation/acObj/Line02211=Your chance to attack this train is slipping away.
Conversation/acObj/Line02212=The train will not wait for you to strike it, commander!
Conversation/acObj/Line02213=The train escaped. I see you don't care about disobeying orders...
Conversation/acObj/Line02214=There goes the train... I wonder how many innocent people will die because it got away?
Conversation/acObj/Line02215=The Moebius train has fled for now... but I will hunt them down eventually, mark my words.
Conversation/acObj/Line02216=That's right! We'll stamp out every last one of these traitors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02217=I can't say that wasn't sublimely satisfying.
Conversation/acObj/Line02218=If only all the treasonous scum could meet their fate like that.
Conversation/acObj/Line02219=So this is how humanity ends... a pity.
Conversation/acObj/Line02220=What this world needed was true defenders... We have failed it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02221=I always knew I'd die in combat--just didn't think it would be here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02222=We're rid of that alien filth! My commendations, soldiers. I'll send word of your deeds back to the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02223=Today you have proved that the human spirit will persevere, no matter how terrible the odds. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02224=You fought like hell out there. I'll remember that. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02225=Don't take all day. If these creatures don't perish, we will.
Conversation/acObj/Line02226=The hybrid's power is growing. We have to go faster!
Conversation/acObj/Line02227=Our scanners show the hybrid's making a lot of progress. So should we.
Conversation/acObj/Line02228=Moebius' victory is imminent! Move, move, move!
Conversation/acObj/Line02229=The pressure's on. We have just a few moments left to kill this hybrid bastard.
Conversation/acObj/Line02230=We're getting down to the wire. Make every minute count.
Conversation/acObj/Line02231=Our time's almost up, and this isn't the kind of place you want to die in.
Conversation/acObj/Line02232=We are on the verge of defeat. Everyone, hurry!
Conversation/acObj/Line02233=This damn alien is about to murder us all! Get moving!
Conversation/acObj/Line02234=Sometimes this really feels like a dead-end job.
Conversation/acObj/Line02235=Oh, I know what you mean. Deader than those death shards.
Conversation/acObj/Line02236=Have you ever wondered what happened to Reigel?
Conversation/acObj/Line02237=Not really. Always seemed like he knew more than he let on, though.
Conversation/acObj/Line02238=The whole battle station is going to fire! This is worse than I ever imagined...
Conversation/acObj/Line02239=We ran out of time! A whole lot of people are going to die because of this...
Conversation/acObj/Line02240=Mission failed... sending my final report to the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02241=Moebius Corps is gonna regret this day. I couldn't have done it without you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02242=Don't know what I would have done if you hadn't happened along, commanders. Thank you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02243=Mission successful! Nice job, commanders, but now I'll be forgetting all about this, and you...
Conversation/acObj/Line02244=These research outposts are transferring their data so they can build additional weapons elsewhere.
Conversation/acObj/Line02245=If you have time to escort your truck to 'em, it will disrupt the connection. Consider it a target of opportunity.
Conversation/acObj/Line02246=These research outposts started transferring their weaponry data as soon as they noticed your presence here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02247=Would you mind taking your truck over? Its artifacts will sever the connection real quick.
Conversation/acObj/Line02248=Moebius Corps knows we're here, and they're transferring their weapons data from the outposts on this battle station.
Conversation/acObj/Line02249=If have a chance, steer your truck that way. It'll corrupt the data and stop it from ever being used elsewhere.
Conversation/acObj/Line02250=A Moebius research outpost has almost finished uploading its data.
Conversation/acObj/Line02251=You'd better hustle if you wanna stop that research outpost, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02252=Moebius has almost finished sending out their research data. Stop 'em if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line02253=You'll find this sector just to the north of your position.
Conversation/acObj/Line02254=This sector is south of your current base of operations.
Conversation/acObj/Line02255=Focus on getting the trucks to the sector west of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02256=Head east, and you'll find the sector before you know it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02257=I'm trusting you to get the trucks to this sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line02258=This is the next sector. I can't wait to see it go up in flames.
Conversation/acObj/Line02259=These trucks are ready to go, commanders. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02260='Fraid we can't wait very long to move the trucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line02261=Don't forget about the trucks, all right?
Conversation/acObj/Line02262=The first truck's in place.
Conversation/acObj/Line02263=That's one truck down.
Conversation/acObj/Line02264=Now for the other truck.
Conversation/acObj/Line02268=Get to safety, it's about to blow!
Conversation/acObj/Line02269=Move out of the blast radius, quickly!
Conversation/acObj/Line02270=Hurry out before it goes up in flames!
Conversation/acObj/Line02271=That sector's gone. You've bought yourselves a little more time, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02272=Well, there's nothing left of that sector. Now it'll take 'em longer to fire the battle station.
Conversation/acObj/Line02273=Demolition complete, and we've delayed them from activating the battle station's weapons.
Conversation/acObj/Line02274=Happy to say we only have three sectors left.
Conversation/acObj/Line02275=Okay, this leaves us with three more sectors to destroy.
Conversation/acObj/Line02276=You'll still need to get trucks to two more sectors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02277=There are two additional sectors to detonate.
Conversation/acObj/Line02278=Hang in there. Just one sector left. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02279=One more sector to go. We can do this!
Conversation/acObj/Line02280=Friendly reminder--we only have so long to finish off the sectors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02281=The battle station's readying its attack. We need to get going.
Conversation/acObj/Line02282=Clock's ticking, everyone!
Conversation/acObj/Line02283=Almost outta time, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line02284=Move those trucks, now!
Conversation/acObj/Line02285=This is our final moment! Go!
Conversation/acObj/Line02286=Bad news, commanders. An attack wave is coming for your truck.
Conversation/acObj/Line02287=Looks like Amon's minions have found your truck's location. Expect an attack soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02288=The enemy's targeting your truck's coordinates. Keep an eye out.
Conversation/acObj/Line02289=Your truck's in some trouble.
Conversation/acObj/Line02290=Protect your truck!
Conversation/acObj/Line02291=The enemy's after your truck.
Conversation/acObj/Line02292=Defend your ally's truck, will ya?
Conversation/acObj/Line02293=Your friend's truck needs some help.
Conversation/acObj/Line02294=Your buddy's truck's getting beat up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02295=Got a replacement truck ready to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line02296=New truck's ready to hit the road.
Conversation/acObj/Line02297=I found another truck for ya.
Conversation/acObj/Line02298=My team scrapped together some new trucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line02299=Both of your trucks have arrived.
Conversation/acObj/Line02300=Two spare trucks have been prepped for ya.
Conversation/acObj/Line02301=Damn, your truck's gone. Don't worry, I've got more here somewhere...
Conversation/acObj/Line02302=The enemy's wrecked your truck. This is gonna take a while to fix.
Conversation/acObj/Line02303=There goes your truck! Time for the backup plan...
Conversation/acObj/Line02304=These trucks don't have cruise control. You gotta guide 'em home.
Conversation/acObj/Line02305=Did you leave a truck behind? They can't do this by themselves, you know!
Conversation/acObj/Line02306=The truck drivers won't go without your say so, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02310=The artifacts in your truck will disarm this construct--like fighting fire with fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line02311=Bring your truck full of artifacts to this construct, and it'll shut down, I promise.
Conversation/acObj/Line02312=Your truck's cargo will neutralize this construct. Just drive it over.
Conversation/acObj/Line02313=That construct's gonna cause a whole heap of trouble unless you bring a truck here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02314=Get your truck to the construct before it melts through your forces!
Conversation/acObj/Line02315=Don't wait too long to get your truck to this construct, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02316=A construct is outta control. Where's your truck?
Conversation/acObj/Line02317=Your forces are dying to a construct. Bring a truck here, quick!
Conversation/acObj/Line02318=A construct's threatening your warriors. Get a truck to them, eh?
Conversation/acObj/Line02319=Well done. The construct's down.
Conversation/acObj/Line02320=Good work. That's one less construct to deal with.
Conversation/acObj/Line02321=You did it! The construct's just rubble now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02322=Moebius Corps constructed a battle station on this platform. We're gonna have to take out each sector of it before it fires on our colonies.
Conversation/acObj/Line02323=These trucks carry xel'naga artifacts that'll destabilize Moebius' technology, but first you'll have to move them into position.
Conversation/acObj/Line02324=Moebius Corps built a battle station on this platform, and we're gonna have to dismantle it sector by sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line02325=I loaded these trucks with xel'naga artifacts that will scramble their setup. Get 'em in place before it's too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line02326=I've never seen a battle station like this. Moebius tech is something else--only xel'naga artifacts seem to affect it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02327=I've placed 'em in these trucks so they can disrupt each sector before it fires on Dominion colonies. But I'll need you to escort them.
Conversation/acObj/Line02328=Those constructs are blocking the way again. Better take care of 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line02329=What do you know... more constructs are trying to deter you. Don't let 'em succeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02330=You've got some company up ahead. Take down those constructs to access the demolition point.
Conversation/acObj/Line02331=You'll have to clear these constructs off the demolition point to get your trucks in there.
Conversation/acObj/Line02332=Those constructs are on the demolition point! Blow 'em up!
Conversation/acObj/Line02333=We didn't make it to the research outpost, but they stopped broadcasting anyway. I wonder why?
Conversation/acObj/Line02334=Huh. The research outposts seem to have had trouble getting a signal after all. Crisis averted.
Conversation/acObj/Line02335=You're not gonna believe this. The outposts just went silent. That's good... I think? 
Conversation/acObj/Line02336="Teleportation by TheSkunk and Pr0nogo." I wonder how it works?

Conversation/acResponses/Line00831=Understood. We shall endeavor to secure it shortly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00832=We should make ready. It will take considerable effort to hold the area once we begin.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00833=Warriors, prepare yourselves. We move for the capture point soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00836=Stand your ground. Let no enemy approach this soil.

Conversation/acResponses/Line01119=Looks like it's gonna need some security.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01120=The objective is in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01121=Providing added security now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01122=Eyes open, people. Enemy's sure to make a play for this thing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01123=Last stop. Good run, everyone.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01124=Objective has reached its destination.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01125=Transit's complete. Package is secure.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01126=End of the line. Well done, people.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01127=Delivered to safety.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01128=Preparing for deployment.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01129=It will have our support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01130=Look alive, people. We've got our orders.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01131=We're supporting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01132=The objective is in range of our support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01133=Weapons free. Supporting the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01134=We're making progress. Stay on the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01135=Almost there. We have to keep going.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01136=Maintain our support. We've got this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01137=It needs our support. Let's get moving!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01138=I won't let that happen. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01139=It's now or never. Support the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01140=Nothing to it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01141=Another mission successful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01142=They underestimated us. Big mistake.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01143=Did they really think they could stop us?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01144=Looks like the enemy couldn't handle us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01145=So it's true what they say about the best offense...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01146=Looks like we've saved the day.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01147=We'll provide the escort, don't worry.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01148=You're in luck. We're the best escort around.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01149=Nothing like an armed escort to send a message.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01150=Escort established. Time to get moving.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01151=Objective is being escorted now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01152=We're moving out. Stay alert.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01153=Now that's a job well done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01154=Nice and easy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01155=That's it? And here I was thinking we were in for a fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01156=Glad to help.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01157=I'm always up for scaring off some bandits.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01158=Dig your heels in, and get ready for a fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01159=Establishing a defensive perimeter now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01160=Let's get everything in place. We're in for the long haul.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01161=Hold the line! We need just a little longer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01162=Do not let the enemy through! That's an order!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01163=Failure is not an option. Keep the perimeter secure!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01164=If there's one thing a sniper knows, it's how to defend her nest.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01165=It's almost time. Do not let the objective fall!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01166=(Laughs)Amon sends his little pets against me. I will tear them apart.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01167=The Tal'darim will crush them into dust.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01168=Ah, the icons of Amon's betrayal. I will enjoy destroying them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01169=They will be the first to know my wrath.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01170=Perhaps they will finally provide me with a challenge. But I doubt it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01171=I shall see to its destruction myself.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01172=Its obliteration will soon be at hand.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01173=The Tal'darim will ensure its demise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01174=The slaughter has begun.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01175=We have found the objective. Now we shall destroy it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01176=It won't be long before the objective crumbles.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01177=Was there ever any doubt?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01178=An inevitable outcome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01179=Hardly a challenge.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01180=Perhaps now we can move on to a real fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01181=Expect nothing less of the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01182=None shall escape me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01183=I will crush them before they can scurry away.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01184=Well, it IS quite satisfying to chase down one's prey.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01185=The objective is within our grasp.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01186=We have hunted down the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01187=The Tal'darim are assaulting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01188=Slay them at once!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01189=We've delayed long enough. Finish this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01190=You are disappointing me, supplicants.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01191=(Scoffs)Pathetic.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01192=A shameful and cowardly death.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01193=Such is the way of the Tal'darim. No prisoners. No survivors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01194=(Laughs)Was the enemy expecting mercy?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01195=All who oppose me shall suffer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01196=Defense is a losing strategy, but I shall seize victory nonetheless.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01197=Let's see if the enemy dares to strike the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01198=This ground is now mine. The enemy will not have it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01199=The enemy falls upon my blades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01200=I shall lay waste to these attackers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01201=Do these fools think they can slip past me?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01202=Yes, yes, well defended. All that matters is my supremacy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01203=The best defense is unrelenting offense.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01204=Only because I willed it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01205=So ends my good deed for the day.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01206=And now you are in my debt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01207=I will seize control of it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01208=My minions will establish control over it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01209=The Tal'darim will control the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01210=The Tal'darim lay claim to this area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01211=The objective will soon be mine.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01212=I am assuming control of the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01213=None can challenge my claim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01214=It now falls under my domain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01215=I do so enjoy conquering new territory.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01216=Did the enemy really think they could withstand the Tal'darim?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01217=Now I control the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01218=The objective will belong to me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01219=It cannot escape my grasp.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01220=I will seize it for myself.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01221=I am capturing the objective as we speak.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01222=It won't be long before the objective is mine.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01223=The Tal'darim are taking the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01224=As if the enemy could have ever stopped me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01225=As I expected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01226=It was mine the moment I decided to take it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01227=Nothing is beyond the Highlord's reach.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01228=Another successful conquest.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01229=It will move under my command.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01230=And I suppose you expect me to be the courier.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01231=The Tal'darim will see to its transport.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01232=I'm moving the objective. None will stop me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01233=The objective advances, as do I.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01234=Transportation has begun. Do try to keep pace.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01235=Be grateful that it had me to command it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01236=Such a menial task. I was hoping for a challenge.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01237=Is that what passes for heroism to you? How utterly boring.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01238=None can stand in my way and survive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01239=The Tal'darim are unstoppable.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01240=We shall see if this is worth my support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01241=Fortunately, I'm feeling generous today.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01242=You are wise to beg for my help.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01243=I'm offering you my support. See that it doesn't go to waste.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01244=The objective has my support. Victory is sure to follow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01245=My support has been given. You may grovel later.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01246=We will soon trample the enemy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01247=I will enjoy crushing the enemy under my heel.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01248=Enough of this little game. I will finish this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01249=If you can't win with MY support, then you are truly hopeless.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01250=It seems that not even the Tal'darim can prevent you from failing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01251=Must I do everything myself?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01252=(Scoffs)Child's play.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01253=Winning is not enough. You must crush the enemy's spirit as well.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01254=An inevitable outcome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01255=Our foes die upon my blades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01256=Perhaps now you can comprehend my true power.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01257=And of course it falls on me to protect it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01258=Feel free to cower in my shadow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01259=Defense is for the meek. The Tal'darim will clear the path.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01260=The sooner we are done with this nonsense, the better.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01261=Is this truly the fastest we can move?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01262=Make haste. My blade thirsts for blood.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01263=That took much too long.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01264=Couldn't you have made this journey yourself?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01265=I don't care. At least the bloodshed kept me entertained.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01266=Our enemies are almost as pathetic as you.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01267=Perhaps now we can move on to an actual fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01268=I will compensate for the weaknesses on display here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01269=The Tal'darim claim the primary battle line.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01270=Am I to stand still and wait? We should take the fight to the enemy!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01271=What is taking so long?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01272=Good. I'm growing tired of this farce.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01273=A pity. There are still so many enemies to slaughter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01274=Our enemy would be wise to surrender now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01275=Let our enemies come. I will enjoy crushing them into dust.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01276=I will see it burn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01277=It won't remain intact for long.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01278=My infested will tear it down.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01279=My forces are attacking the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01280=The objective's destruction is assured.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01281=It is time to crush the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01282=I will see the enemy in hell.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01283=That didn't last long, did it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01284=Dasvidanya.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01285=Is that all there was?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01286=A simple but welcome victory.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01287=We will not allow it to escape.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01288=It will not get past us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01289=My forces will see to its demise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01290=The objective will soon be destroyed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01291=My forces are assaulting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01292=We will tear the objective apart.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01293=Do not let the objective escape!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01294=The objective must not slip through our fingers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01295=We have wasted too much time. Destroy the damn thing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01296=Say goodnight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01297=Escape was never an option for them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01298=They picked the wrong fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01299=Killing a fleeing adversary. How... familiar.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01300=Reminds me of duck hunting back on Earth.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01301=We will establish a defensive perimeter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01302=Do not worry. We will kill anyone who gets close.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01303=My forces will defend the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01304=These bastards want to kill us. They will be disappointed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01305=I will kill these dogs. And then I will find a use for them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01306=Our opponents will not take this objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01307=Perhaps now the enemy understands.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01308=It is good to be the hero for a change.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01309=I suppose my infested make for good guard dogs.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01310=Such an amateur strategy. I expected better from our enemies.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01311=The objective stands, and our enemies fall.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01312=We will take control of the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01313=My infested will occupy the area soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01314=I will send my forces to establish control.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01315=We are taking the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01316=The objective will be ours shortly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01317=My forces are securing the area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01318=We have succeeded in taking the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01319=The objective has been claimed... but I will refrain from infesting it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01320=Area secured. Ah, this takes me back to my days in the UED.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01321=Our opponent hardly stood a chance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01322=My forces are... unorthodox, but effective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01323=My forces will acquire the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01324=It will be in our possession soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01325=Then it's time to move.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01326=My infested are taking the objective. They are... excited.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01327=We are capturing the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01328=The objective will soon be ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01329=I still know a thing or two about leading an army.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01330=Ah, we have secured the objective. Well done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01331=It is good that our goals are aligned.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01332=Our victory is assured.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01333=The enemy was foolish for underestimating us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01334=We will take it where it needs to go.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01335=It will be transported safely.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01336=We are prepared to transport it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01337=Commencing transportation now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01338=My army is transporting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01339=We have the objective in tow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01340=Our opponent thought they could stop us. They were mistaken.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01341=Good. My forces, they grow impatient.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01342=And I used to hate it when I was ordered to transport cargo.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01343=This mission is going well. I suggest we keep it that way.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01344=So much violence for such a humble task.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01345=Well, this should certainly be interesting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01346=My infested will be close by. Reassuring, yes? <Dark chuckle>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01347=You will have the support you need.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01348=My forces are providing their support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01349=We are in range of the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01350=The objective has my support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01351=We are making progress. It won't be long now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01352=Continue pushing forward. The end is in sight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01353=My forces are endless. Our mission, not so much.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01354=Enough. Let us push back and end this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01355=If we are to die here, we will at least put up a fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01356=This cannot be how it ends. We must bolster our support!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01357=Not so easy to stand against a tide of zerg, is it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01358=Our opponent lacked the conviction that we possess.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01359=My army might be monsters, but that is what makes us strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01360=The enemy lies broken before us. I suppose I should let my infested feed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01361=Ah, Gerard would have liked to witness that one.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01362=I will instruct my forces to accompany it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01363=It will move under my army's protection.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01364=My infested will provide it with an escort.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01365=My forces are in position. Time to move out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01366=The objective is now in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01367=We are moving alongside the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01368=I was once a vice admiral in the UED. This is simple by comparison.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01369=Our opponents lack a basic understanding of strategy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01370=Perhaps even the infested can serve a purpose.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01371=Of course. My troops are mindless, but they are also obedient.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01372=Death means nothing to the infested. Did the enemy think we would fear it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01373=Do not worry. I will refrain from infesting this location.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01374=Trust me, it is very difficult to rid a place of the infested.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01375=My forces will fortify this position.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01376=We will hold. It is not so easy to kill what's already dead.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01377=Maybe we die. Maybe we win. Maybe both.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01378=Our fortifications will not be breached.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01379=I have endured far worse than this. I will not be defeated.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01380=This will all be over soon, one way or another.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01381=Narud's handiwork. Destroying them will be satisfying.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01382=Mengsk was a fool to think he could control them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01383=These monsters should not exist. I will make it so.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01384=I watched them grow as I was tortured. Now I will watch them die.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01385=Amon's secret weapon. We will rid him of them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01386=These hybrid abominations must be destroyed!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01387=Amon has set loose his hybrid.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01388=Not even the hybrid can withstand our might!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01389=We shall cut through these vile hybrid!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01390=I fear no hybrid!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01391=We shall be the end of it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01392=It will not stand against us for long.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01393=My warriors will destroy it at once.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01394=The Purifiers are assaulting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01395=My warriors are laying the objective to waste!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01396=To battle! We attack the objective now!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01397=My warriors never falter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01398=Glory to the Daelaam!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01399=Another victory for the Purifiers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01400=Hardly a match for my blades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01401=Ah, the thrill of battle!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01402=It will not escape so easily!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01403=No target is beyond our reach.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01404=The Purifiers will surely stop it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01405=We strike at the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01406=My forces are attacking the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01407=The objective is in our sights.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01408=We must not allow the objective to escape!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01409=The objective must fall! Redouble our efforts!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01410=Do not lose the objective! Strike it down!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01411=As expected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01412=There was never a doubt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01413=None can withstand the might of the Purifiers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01414=It died without a shred of honor.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01415=We are victorious!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01416=We shall be its shield.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01417=It will remain safe under our watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01418=Our enemies will die before they reach it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01419=My warriors are holding the enemy back.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01420=We are defending the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01421=The Purifiers will not allow the objective to fall.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01422=The Purifiers can defeat any foe!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01423=Our defenses are impenetrable!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01424=It was foolish for the enemy to challenge us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01425=Revel in our triumph!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01426=No sacrifice is too great.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01427=We shall take control of it soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01428=My forces are prepared to mobilize.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01429=It will soon be under our control.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01430=The enemy shall not set foot here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01431=We will destroy these interlopers at once.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01432=This area is under our protection!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01433=Our claim is secure.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01434=We claim this area in the name of the Purifiers!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01435=We have secured the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01436=The objective is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01437=Our foes never stood a chance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01438=It will soon be within our grasp.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01439=We shall acquire it without delay.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01440=My forces will set out to capture it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01441=We have taken the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01442=The objective is in our possession.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01443=The Purifiers have claimed the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01444=You bring honor to us all, my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01445=Our might cannot be overcome!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01446=A glorious achievement.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01447=We have succeeded!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01448=Victory is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01449=The Purifiers will see it to its destination.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01450=We will transport it at once.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01451=It shall be taken where it needs to be.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01452=The objective is in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01453=My forces are transporting the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01454=We have mobilized the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01455=We have delivered the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01456=Transportation successful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01457=The objective has been transported.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01458=There is no task we cannot accomplish.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01459=Well struck, warriors!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01460=We will lend our strength to it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01461=Together, we shall stand as one!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01462=The Purifiers are ready to provide support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01463=My forces are with the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01464=We stand with the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01465=The objective has our support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01466=Victory is within sight! Press on!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01467=Continue supporting the objective! This will soon be over.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01468=Push forward! Our enemies are outmatched!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01469=We will wrest victory from the jaws of defeat.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01470=Do not give in to despair. Fight to the last!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01471=Fight with valor. Die with honor.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01472=We have trampled our foes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01473=The Purifiers stand strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01474=Victory is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01475=Our enemies scatter before us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01476=In unity, we emerge triumphant.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01477=The Purifiers shall march beside it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01478=Its safety shall be assured.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01479=We will vanquish any who threaten it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01480=We are protecting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01481=No harm shall come to the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01482=The objective is under the shield of the Purifiers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01483=We have seen the objective to a safe arrival.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01484=The Purifiers serve with honor and distinction.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01485=And so our journey is complete.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01486=Noble warriors, the day is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01487=Valiantly done!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01488=None shall pass.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01489=Our enemies will break upon our ramparts.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01490=The Purifiers stand in defense.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01491=The battle is not yet over! Stand strong, Purifiers!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01492=Hold the line! Let none through!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01493=We shall stand eternal!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01494=Our enemies will not prevail!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01495=They shall not set foot upon this area!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01496=Hybrid essence? No use.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01497=Cannot assimilate. Must kill.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01498=They are dust. We are the wind.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01499=I will hunt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01500=They do not adapt. They will die.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01501=I go to destroy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01502=Kill. Maim. Destroy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01503=<acknowledging growl>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01504=Near objective. Pack will strike.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01505=We fight to take the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01506=Attacking objective. Primal zerg are strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01507=Yes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01508=One dies, one grows strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01509=We evolve. We overcome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01510=No match for our claws.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01511=<triumphant roar>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01512=It flees, but we will follow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01513=I hunt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01514=We capture.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01515=Seizing objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01516=Strike! The target will be ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01517=Sink your claws into the prey, my pack.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01518=No.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01519=We are primal zerg. We pursue.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01520=Claim it as ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01521=I cannot be stopped!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01522=Not all will survive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01523=It could not adapt. We could.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01524=It was ash to our fire.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01525=We are always moving, always collecting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01526=We defend.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01527=Protect this one.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01528=Guard it, or suffer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01529=Do not let them destroy the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01530=Enemies gather, but we will protect what is ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01531=We must keep the objective secure.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01532=Always.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01533=Survival is foremost.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01534=We provide.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01535=Watchful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01536=<proud snarl>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01537=I savor the hunt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01538=We capture. We collect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01539=The pack will go.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01540=I take what is mine.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01541=Fighting for control. We must succeed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01542=Attack. Take it now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01543=Good.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01544=<growl> Collected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01545=My pack is strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01546=We move closer to victory.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01547=Strong essence will prevail.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01548=I will collect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01549=Forward!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01550=My pack will take it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01551=Seizing objective. Those who interfere will suffer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01552=Primal zerg fight for objective. All else fades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01553=Capturing target. We are relentless.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01554=It is ours. Prey belongs to the hunter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01555=None can tear it from our claws.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01556=I take. I collect. I grow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01557=So it will remain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01558=My pack is swift.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01559=Rise and defend.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01560=It is weak. We shall be its strength.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01561=We are the wind that drives it forth.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01562=We move.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01563=Proceed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01564=Objective in motion. We are watchful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01565=Impressive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01566=We flow as a river. Never stopping.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01567=We are a force. A wave.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01568=Test me and learn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01569=The strong survive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01570=Never doubt our strength.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01571=My pack will protect it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01572=We follow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01573=We approach the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01574=Guarding objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01575=My pack watches over the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01576=We thrive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01577=Enemies fall. Primal zerg rise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01578=Triumph in reach.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01579=Find strength, then victory. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01580=We cannot fall like leaves. We must hold.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01581=Send warriors. My pack is weak.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01582=This is the law of survival.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01583=You are impressed, no?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01584=Our essence is strong. Even more than expected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01585=We break our enemies.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01586=There was no other path.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01587=We go. We protect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01588=I see. I will guide it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01589=It is weak, but my pack is not.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01590=Battle is upon us!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01591=We guard with claws and fangs.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01592=My pack escorts the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01593=Secure, for now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01594=Adversity begets change.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01595=We have come far. But we must go further.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01596=My pack is large. Well-adapted.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01597=We advance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01598=Primal zerg are ready.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01599=Yes, as One-who-collects.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01600=I will kill enemies and take their essence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01601=I wait. I watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01602=Primal zerg will triumph.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01603=Pleasing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01604=Fight until none are left to collect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01605=<satisfied growl>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01606=Sounds like a problem explosives can solve.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01607=We'll blast it to bits.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01608=I'll prepare countermeasures.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01609=We've killed them before, and we'll do it again.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01610=Everywhere we go, there they are.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01611=Hmph. That's all?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01612=I could blow that up in my sleep. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01613=I'm gonna need your help with this one, Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01614=I'll get this demolition started.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01615=Heading for the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01616=Moving out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01617=Boom!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01618=Beautiful, isn't it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01619=This is what I do.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01620=Sometimes your destructive power impresses even me, Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01621=Are we done yet?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01622=It is fast, but not faster than us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01623=Let's get this over with.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01624=I think we can manage this, Mira. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01625=I am tracking down the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01626=I'm going to mess with this target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01627=Setting a course for the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01628=No one escapes me!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01629=If I can't get out of here, then it can't either.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01630=Not on my watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01631=Hah. That was charming.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01632=There is nothing we cannot do, husband.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01633=And beautifully so.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01634=One step closer to the end of this fight...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01635=Well, this isn't all bad.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01636=I only defend Matthew, usually. But I'll make an exception.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01637=I'll keep it as safe as I can with a crazed mercenary by my side.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01638=I'll do my best to protect it. Especially from Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01639=I am protecting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01640=Setting up my defenses now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01641=Beginning defensive maneuvers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01642=Nothing can defeat the power of love.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01643=I will expect a generous payment for this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01644=I guess that was worth it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01645=That went better than I thought.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01646=If it comes down to it, we can work together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01647=And I am ready to blow up my enemies.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01648=Then there is no reason to hesitate!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01649=No use waiting around, is there, Mira?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01650=I'm going to have a little fun.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01651=My forces are securing the area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01652=Capturing the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01653=It's mine, all mine...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01654=I like taking things that don't belong to me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01655=Leave it to a mercenary...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01656=Nicely done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01657=Maybe there was no reason to worry.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01658=It will be ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01659=We'll ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01660=All right. I think we can make the best of this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01661=I'm taking what is mine!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01662=Time to pick up a little something special.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01663=Capture expedition underway.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01664=Good. Otherwise I'd be very upset.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01665=Isn't it wonderful, Matthew?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01666=Another one down.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01667=Not everything about this situation is a failure.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01668=I'll give you this, Mira. You're good at taking things.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01669=Hah, too easy. Have you seen my ship?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01670=Let's enjoy these precious moments together, husband.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01671=And I'm ready to get this done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01672=The objective is all mine. Moving it now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01673=Getting this objective in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01674=This objective's on the move. Our enemies will probably take notice.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01675=I aim to please... 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01676=I'd do it all again for more time with my husband.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01677=You can thank me later.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01678=Just doing my job.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01679=Isn't that a nice surprise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01680=Not my specialty, but I will cooperate this time.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01681=We'll do what we have to.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01682=Orders received.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01683=We are securing this thing one way or another.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01684=My crew is taking a protective formation around the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01685=Whatever happens, we'll defend this from the enemy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01686=Keep going like this, and Matthew and I can finally enjoy our honeymoon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01687=Good work. We're almost there.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01688=We're making good progress. Keep it coming.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01689=Mira's Marauders do not fail!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01690=Well, you like it rough, don't you, Matthew? 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01691=This isn't a best-case scenario... but we have to try!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01692=My reputation demands no less.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01693=Of course it did. My crew gets the job done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01694=Well, what do you know...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01695=At least we're somewhat effective together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01696=I guess I've seen worse partnerships...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01697=First we work, then we play--right, darling?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01698=Whatever gets my mind off this situation is fine by me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01699=The things I do for the Dominion...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01700=Enough waiting! I'll get this objective in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01701=The objective is blasting along like my best explosives.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01702=I'm getting this convoy underway.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01703=Wonderful. Matthew and I will finally have some alone time.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01704=What can I say? We are very good together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01705=I can't believe this is working.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01706=I guess our long, sordid history is good for something, Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01707=Sometimes I can't tell if I have the worst luck or the best.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01708=With Matthew on my side, I hardly need to prepare at all.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01709=Preparation is overrated. Spontaneity wins wars.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01710=If everything goes to plan, we might just manage.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01711=Don't try anything funny unless you really want to test my patience.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01712=Hold a little longer, and there is enough reward for all of us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01713=No use giving up now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01714=We've fought too long to lose ground here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01715=Everyone's relying on us. We can't let them down.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01716=Hybrid? Damn, you really outdid yourselves.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01717=Let's bust it open.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01718=I'll get the demo squad together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01719=It's party time. I'm heading for the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01720=What'd y'all expect?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01721=Eyes open! We got ourselves a live one.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01722=I'm gonna get real nice and cozy with this target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01723=Oh hell no.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01724=Sure do hope they said their goodbyes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01725=I'll get the babysitters.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01726=Defensive forces going in.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01727=Heheh, hot damn, we are good!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01728=You heard 'em. Let's go.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01729=Locking down the area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01730=We're not just good--we're good-lookin' also, heh.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01731=Can't wait to get my mitts on it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01732=Rest easy. We got the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01733=Tell me something I don't know.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01734=What do I look like, a shipping company?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01735=We're nudging the objective along, real careful-like.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01736=Ain't that sweet.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01737=Keep this puppy safe... or else.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01738=We're on guard duty now, amigos.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01739=I love it when you sweet talk me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01740=Pull it together, boys and girls!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01741=Aw, you're gonna make me blush.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01742=Great. I love babysitting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01743=Convoy rolling out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01744=Yeah. Now can I get a little respect around here?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01745=No problem. Just don't tell me the odds.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01746=It's gonna get rougher before it gets smoother.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01747=Aw, you didn't tell me your mama was comin'.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01748=Time to kill some ugly sons of... whatever they are.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01749=Hope y'all have strong stomachs, heh.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01750=They are in for a world of pain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01751=Can't wait to rip it apart.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01752=The Heaven's Devils are moving in to attack. Try not to get too excited.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01753=We're going to strike the objective. Just sit back and watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01754=You get what you deserve.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01755=I noticed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01756=Yeah, yeah. Tell me about it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01757=And you thought you couldn't trust me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01758=Stay frosty. It's on the move.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01759=Why's it gotta run away like that?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01760=The Devils are going after the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01761=I'm in hot pursuit of the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01762=No chance of that.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01763=Enough messin' around.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01764=Damn straight it was.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01765=Heaven's Devils style!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01766=Love it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01767=No one pisses us off.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01768=Looks like we gotta defend this bad boy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01769=All we gotta do is keep it in one piece.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01770=We're protecting the objective. Thank us later.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01771=The Devils are shielding the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01772=Hah! That is the way you do it!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01773=You can tell me how great I am later... or now, if you'd like.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01774=I'd do a little dance, but I'm busy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01775=Now THAT's an ass-kicking!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01776=I ain't gonna stand on ceremony here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01777=That's fine. I hate waiting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01778=The Devils are holding their ground.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01779=We're right on the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01780=I should be paid more.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01781=And I didn't even have to break out the extra special stimpacks...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01782=Yeah, I'm impressed too.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01783=Keep it up.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01784=And I'm feelin' antsy. Let's do this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01785=Yeah, yeah, I hear ya. Gettin' a move on.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01786=The objective's mine, and I don't share well.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01787=See that objective? I'm gonna nab it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01788=I'm ready for my pay out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01789=Ab-so-lutely.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01790=Not bad at all.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01791=Good ol' Tychus does it again.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01792=Sounds easy. Maybe too easy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01793=Lucky for you, the Devils are on it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01794=Giving the objective a little ol' push out the door.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01795=Transporting the objective, pronto.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01796=It's hard work being this good.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01797=Have I ever disappointed ya?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01798=What a purty picture.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01799=Watch and learn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01800=Anything's possible--for the right price.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01801=The Heaven's Devils have it covered.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01802=Securing the objective, 'cause I didn't have anything better to do today.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01803=Let's defend this damn thing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01804=Stay cool. We're almost there.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01805=Keep your shirt on--we're nearly done!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01806=Y'all don't wanna see me lose my temper, do ya?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01807=Failure? Never heard the word.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01808=Yeah, you're welcome, cupcake.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01809=No trouble at all...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01810=I'm sure there's more where that came from.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01811=All thanks to me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01812=We'll keep it real safe and sound, partner.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01813=Who picks these jobs, anyway?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01814=The Devils are moving out with the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01815=My gang's got the objective truckin' along.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01816=Just earnin' my keep.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01817=Talk it up a little bit more, would ya?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01818=I wish the original Devils could see this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01819=Nice job, everyone.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01820=Make yourselves comfortable. We gonna be here a good while.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01821=Hope y'all like being punching bags.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01822=And I am nearing the end of my patience!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01823=This is where they'll really try to screw us over, ain't it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01824=Whaddaya know. We might just survive this thing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01825=Don't drop the ball now, Devils. We almost got this!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01826=These abominations must be slain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01827=We will return them to the Void.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01828=They are a threat to us all. We will end them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01829=Amon will stop at nothing to subjugate us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01830=From the shadows they shall fall.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01831=We will not suffer its presence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01832=It shall be obliterated.

VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Auto_HelpMe00=I require more minions to fuel my power.
VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Auto_HelpMe01=I fight the enemy while your army stands idle. Are they afraid, or just lazy?

VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_MineralsNeeded02=If you're not going to use your minerals, at least bolster my supply.

VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_MineralsReceived02=Are you waiting for me to thank you? <Laughs> Typical.
VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_ResourcesGiven00=I do not require these resources to win. Do with them what you will.
VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_ResourcesGiven01=These resources will only weigh me down. Hold onto them for me.

VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_VespeneNeeded01=This planet's meager vespene is insufficient. Supply me with more.
VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_VespeneNeeded02=Give me your vespene, and I will put it to better use than you ever could.
VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_VespeneReceived00=Is that all the vespene you could spare?
VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_VespeneReceived01=Hmph. I suppose this amount of vespene is better than nothing.
VoiceOver/AlarakCommander/Trade_VespeneReceived02=The vespene is mine. Your obedience will be noted.
