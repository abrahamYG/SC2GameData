UI/ScreenMatchmaking/AgentsOnLadderOptIn/DetailHeader1=What's happening?
UI/ScreenMatchmaking/AgentsOnLadderOptIn/DetailText1=We’re excited to announce that experimental versions of DeepMind’s StarCraft II agent, AlphaStar, will soon play a small number of games on the competitive ladder as part of ongoing scientific research into artificial intelligence.</n></n>If you would like the chance to help DeepMind with its research by matching against AlphaStar, you can <s val="Versus_AgentsOnLadderOptIn_SectionTextHighlight">opt-in</s> by clicking the button below. If you opt-in and are matched against AlphaStar, DeepMind will use and may publish your match data and game replays in accordance with the terms below. Your username will not be published.  You can alter your opt-in selection at any time by using the “DeepMind opt-in” button on the 1v1 Versus menu.</n></n>For scientific test purposes, DeepMind will be benchmarking the system’s performance by playing AlphaStar anonymously during a series of blind trial matches. This means the StarCraft community will not know which matches AlphaStar is playing, to help ensure all games are played under the same conditions. AlphaStar plays with built-in restrictions defined in consultation with pro players. A win or a loss against AlphaStar will affect your MMR as normal.</n></n>Thank you to everyone who has helped our work with DeepMind so far, and to all those who continue to support us as we push the boundaries of what’s possible in StarCraft!
UI/ScreenMatchmaking/AgentsOnLadderOptIn/DetailHeader2=Terms & Conditions
UI/ScreenMatchmaking/AgentsOnLadderOptIn/DetailText2=If you are matched against AlphaStar, DeepMind Technologies Limited (a company organised under the laws of England and Wales) will use the games, game replays and game data created to conduct research on the development of machine learning, which may include publication of some replays.</n></n>DeepMind will process any personal data contained in games, game replays and game data on the basis of its legitimate interest in pursuing research into machine learning and the further development of AlphaStar and other artificial intelligence agents. DeepMind will handle any personal data in accordance with the privacy policy which can be reviewed using the link below.

UI/UserProfileLadderDivisionFrame/GrandmasterAbout=About
UI/UserProfileLadderDivisionFrame/GrandmasterInfo=The Grandmaster League is an exclusive league with limited open slots where the top StarCraft II players in each region can compete against each other to test their mettle.<n/><n/>Qualification is determined after the first week in a new season. After the first week, candidates must play one more match in order to receive their promotion. Grandmaster rankings are calculated daily, thus players below the MMR cutoff will be demoted from Grandmaster to make room for those who are above the required MMR threshold.<n/><n/>Players positioned for a spot in Grandmaster will be placed into a Contender List, where they can more easily view the players battling for a coveted slot in the next Grandmaster promotion. Demoted players will have a window of time in the Contender List to earn their spot back before the rankings are calculated for that day.<n/><n/>In order to retain a spot in Grandmaster, a minimum of 30 games every 3 weeks must be played. Bonus pool is not accumulated in Grandmaster. If a player is inactive, they will be automatically demoted and a more active combatant will fill the empty slot.<n/><n/>Congratulations to all those qualified in the Grandmaster League and good luck!
