EDSTR_ENUMHINT_e_targetModeValidationNone=Target mode will stay active until a target is chosen or it is canceled.
EDSTR_ENUMHINT_e_targetModeValidationPresent=Target mode will stay active until a target is chosen, it is canceled, or no units provide the command.
EDSTR_ENUMHINT_e_targetModeValidationStrict=Target mode will stay active until a target is chosen, it is canceled, or no units can issue the command.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundCategoryDefaults_MixerPriority=A sound with a higher priority than another sound will not be stolen or made virtual by that sound. 0 = most important. 256 = least important.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundCategoryDefaults_MixerPriorityNonLocal=Mixer priority to use for non local sounds. A value of -1 means to use the same priority as local sounds.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_MuteControl=Set the mute control for this category
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_VolumeControl=Set the volume control for this category
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_LocalVolumeAdjustment=Applies a volume adjustment when a sound is played owned by the local player.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_NonLocalVolumeAdjustment=Applies a volume adjustment when a sound is played not owned by the local player.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_CategoryDuckingFadeTimeIn=How long in milliseconds to fade to the ducked volume.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_CategoryDuckingFadeTimeOut=How long in milliseconds to fade back to normal volume.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_CategoryDucking=The volume to duck other categories to when a sound is playing in this category.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_CategoryDuckingNonLocal=The volume to duck non local sounds in other categories to when a sound is playing in this category.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_MinimumDuckingLevel=Since multiple situations can cause volume ducking on a sound category, this field allows you to define a minimum ducking level for this category, to keep it above the specified volume level at all times.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_MaxMethod=This decides how the max counts are enforced.  Prevent = new sounds don't play.  Replace = old sounds are destroyed to make way for new sounds.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_MaxCountPerPlayer=The maximum number of audible sounds allowed to be played in this category per player.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_MaxCountGlobal=The maximum number of audible sounds allowed to be played in this category total.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SSoundData_MaxPrioritization=This determines the order that duplicate sounds are destroyed in.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SGlobalSoundData_SoundDistanceFactor=Sound distance factor, multiplied by terrain type's factor.  Used only for doppler effect.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SGlobalSoundData_SoundDopplerFactor=Sound doppler factor, multiplied by terrain type's factor.  Used for doppler effect.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SGlobalSoundData_SoundRolloffFactor=Sound rolloff factor, multiplied by terrain type's factor.  Sound volume attenuation over distance factor.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SGlobalSoundData_HeadphoneModeMinAngle=The angle range (0-360) of a 3D sound in relation to the listener, at which the HRTF function begins to have an effect. 0 = in front of the listener. 180 = from 90 degrees to the left of the listener to 90 degrees to the right. 360 = behind the listener.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SGlobalSoundData_HeadphoneModeMaxAngle=The angle range (0-360) of a 3D sound in relation to the listener, at which the HRTF function has maximum effect. 0 = front of the listener. 180 = from 90 degrees to the left of the listener to 90 degrees to the right. 360 = behind the listener.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SGlobalSoundData_HeadphoneModeFrequency=The cutoff frequency of the HRTF's lowpass filter function when at maximum effect.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SMixRoute_ParentCategory=What category should this category mix into?  'Unknown' means master output.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SCutsceneAssetPath_Theme=What glue theme belongs to this cutscene asset path
