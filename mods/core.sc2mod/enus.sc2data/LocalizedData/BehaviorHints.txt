EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SDamageResponse_Evade=Marks the effect dealing damage as evaded - a state which can be detected by validators (typically used to prevent secondary effects from being applied). It does not actually prevent damage or secondary effects by itself.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SDamageResponse_DamageValue=What damage value is used in the damage calculations.  Remaining - The amount of damage left to be done, possibly modified by other damage responses.  Original - The amount of damage to be done before any other damage responses modified it.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SDamageResponse_ProvideCategories=Used to check against existing response prevention requests.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SDamageResponse_PreventCategories=Used to prevent subsequent responses that match any of these categories.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_HealDealtMultiplier=Heal Dealt Multipliers are multiplied together.  0.5 would halve the healing, 2.0 would double the healing.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_HealTakenMultiplier=Heal Dealt Multipliers are multiplied together.  0.5 would halve the healing, 2.0 would double the healing.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_HealDealtAdditiveMultiplier=Heal Dealt Additive Multipliers are added together.  1.0 would be a 100% increase in healing, -0.5 would be a 50% decrease in healing.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_HealTakenAdditiveMultiplier=Heal Dealt Additive Multipliers are added together.  1.0 would be a 100% increase in healing, -0.5 would be a 50% decrease in healing.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_MoveSpeedMultiplier=Movement speed multipliers are multiplied together.  0.5 would halve the speed, 2.0 would double the speed.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_AdditiveMoveSpeedFactor=Additive move speed factors are added together.  1.0 would be a 100% increase in speed, -0.5 would be a 50% decrease in speed.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_AttackSpeedMultiplier=Attack speed multipliers are multiplied together.  0.5 would halve the speed, 2.0 would double the speed.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_AdditiveAttackSpeedFactor=Additive attack speed factors are added together.  1.0 would be a 100% increase in speed, -0.5 would be a 50% decrease in speed.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_VitalMaxArray=Adjusts maximum vitals by these amounts
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_VitalMaxFractionArray=Adds this much percent of starting (unbuffed) vitals.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_VitalMaxAdditiveMultiplierArray=Max Vital Additive Multipliers are added together.  1.0 would be a 100% increase in amount, -0.5 would be a 50% decrease in amount. Applied after all other max vital calculations.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_SModification_VitalRegenMultiplier=These are added together before being applied to regeneration.  1.0 would be a 100% increase in regeneration, -0.5 would be a 50% decrease in regeneration.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CBehaviorBuff_PeriodicEffectRateMultiplier=Speed multipliers are multiplied together.  0.5 would halve the speed, 2.0 would double the speed.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CBehaviorBuff_PeriodicDisplayEffect=Effect used to calculate expected change in vitals for status bars. (Damage over time or heal over time)
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CBehaviorBuff_VitalRegenVitalsRemain=Regen Modification is applied to vital regeneration for as many multiples of Amount Missing are missing from the vital
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CBehaviorBuff_VitalRegenVitalsRemainPercent=Regen Modification is applied to vital regeneration for as many multiples of Amount Missing are missing from the vital percentage
