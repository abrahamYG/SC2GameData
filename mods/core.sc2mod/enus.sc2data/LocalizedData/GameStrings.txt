Missile/BlendAtNotGreaterThanStopAt=BlendAt[%1] not > StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phases[%4, %5].  The blend out termination distance of a given phase must be at a further distance than the stop distance of the prior phase.
Missile/CannotHaveBlendOnFinalPhase=Cannot have blend on final phase.  Mover[%1].
Missile/CannotHaveNegativeOutroRanges=Cannot have negative outro ranges.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/CannotHaveZeroStopAtDistanceOnZeroethPhase=Cannot have 0 stopAt distance on zeroeth phase if there is more than 1 phase.  Mover[%1].
Missile/CannotPowerslideOnNonPositiveAccel=Cannot use powerslide on phases with non-positive acceleration.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/EmptyThrowVector=Empty throw vector.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/InvalidPitchThrowBand=Invalid pitch throw band.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/InvalidYawThrowBand=Invalid yaw throw band.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/NoMotionDriver=No motion driver.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAt=StopAt[%1] not >= BlendAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[0].  The distance at which a phase completely stops must be at or past the distance at which the phase starts to blend out.
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAtPhase=StopAt[%1] not >= BlendAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4].  The distance at which a phase completely stops must be at or past the distance at which the phase starts to blend out.
Missile/UnsupportedNegativeBlendAtAndPositiveStopAt=Unsupported - negative BlendAt[%1] and positive StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4].  Cannot specify the start of a blend out for a phase with respect to the target, while simultaneously specifying the final stop distance of that phase with respect to the launch point.  This would create varying and probably unexpected behaviors as launch and target points varied in distance from one another.
Missile/UnsupportedNonGroundHeightMap=CMoverMissile[%1]; Missiles only support the ground height map.  The air height map enables fliers to move smoothly over cliffs -- it offers no assistance to missiles and would only causes glitches in missiles that need to be near the ground.  It is therefore ignored on missiles.
Missile/ZeroGravityOnBallisticMover=Zero gravity on ballistic mover.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].

UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/FrameRate=<c val="ffffff">Framerate:</c><n/>Framerate refers to the number of frames recorded per second. A higher framerate will result in smoother video playback at a cost of larger video files. Recording at a higher framerate may slow down your game experience.
