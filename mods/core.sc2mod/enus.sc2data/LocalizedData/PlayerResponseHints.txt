EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CPlayerResponseUnit_ProvideCategories=Used to check against existing response prevention requests.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CPlayerResponseUnit_PreventCategories=Used to prevent subsequent responses that match any of these categories.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CPlayerResponseUnitDamage_Evade=Marks the effect dealing damage as evaded - a state which can be detected by validators (typically used to prevent secondary effects from being applied). It does not actually prevent damage or secondary effects by itself.
EDSTR_FIELDHINT_CPlayerResponseUnitDamage_DamageValue=What damage value is used in the damage calculations.  Remaining - The amount of damage left to be done, possibly modified by other damage responses.  Original - The amount of damage to be done before any other damage responses modified it.
