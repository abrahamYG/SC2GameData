Map/LoadingHelp/Nova01=Nova is a hero unit with special abilities. You can select her by pressing <c val="ffff00"><k val="HeroSelect0"/></c> or clicking the icon in the upper left corner of the screen.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova02=Enemy forces require flying units in order to see your units on the high ground. Use this to set up ambushes and avoid retaliation.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova03=Defend your base with Bunkers and Siege Tanks. If they become damaged, use SCVs to repair them.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova04=Banshees excel at dealing damage, but not at surviving it. Use their Cloak ability and avoid detectors to keep them alive.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova05=Setting up Liberators in Defender Mode over strategic choke points makes for an effective defensive strategy.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova06=Experiment with different equipment and unit technology in response to the types of enemies you expect to combat.

Map/LoadingHelp/Nova08=The battle spans the entire city. Use the subway system to quickly transport your army from point to point.
Map/LoadingHelp/Nova09=The Xanthos can repair itself after taking heavy damage, but it is vulnerable while doing so. Strike it down before it finishes its repairs.

Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova02=Construct additional Barracks or Reactor add-ons to produce multiple army units at once.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova03=If you order your units to attack a point on the ground, they will engage all enemies they encounter along the way. This is called an attack move.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova04=The zerg will retaliate after Nova's base has been established. Destroy as many Hatcheries as you can to weaken their future attacks.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova05=The Infested are drawn toward active Extraction Devices. Set up your defenses before initiating the process.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova06=Unit selections made during flashbacks determine which types of enemies you will encounter. Choose wisely.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova07=If an encounter is proving difficult, try a new approach with different equipment.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/Nova08=Gorgons can fire in all directions as they pass through the city. Time their use well to take out as many enemies as possible.

Map/Summary/Nova01=Nova has escaped from a mysterious facility where she and several other ghosts were being held captive. Unanswered questions race through her mind as she attempts to reestablish contact with the Dominion, hoping that they can shed some light on who she was with and why she was there.
Map/Summary/Nova02=Nova has learned that she is wanted for treason, having been seen working with a terrorist group known as the Defenders of Man... the same group who thwarted a sudden zerg attack on the Dominion world of Borea. Now under the Dominion's orders once again, it's up to Nova to unravel the Defenders' plans.
Map/Summary/Nova03=By restoring a portion of her wiped memories, Nova has located and infiltrated a Defenders of Man base on Tarsonis. She has discovered that they are controlling their own zerg brood and using it to stage attacks on Dominion worlds across the sector. Her team now races toward an imminent zerg attack on a densely populated civilian planet.
Map/Summary/Nova04=Though she was too late to stop the infestation of Tyrador IX, Nova has rescued the planet's civilian survivors from both the zerg and the Tal'darim. But her efforts have also strengthened the Defenders of Man, who have claimed the credit for the evacuation.
Map/Summary/Nova05=Having won Alarak's challenge, Nova now possesses the terrazine she needs in order to remember her history with the Defenders of Man. Despite the risks involved, she is confident that using the terrazine will reveal the identity of their leader.
Map/Summary/Nova06=Nova has learned the disturbing truth of her time with the Defenders of Man, and she now has the evidence needed to bring them to justice. But Valerian has ordered Nova to wait and trust in his plan... which involves him stepping down as emperor of the Dominion.
Map/Summary/Nova07=Nova has successfully infiltrated Davis's compound and has placed her under arrest. Once Valerian reveals the evidence of Davis's crimes and her leadership of the Defenders of Man at the end of his speech, the Dominion can at last return to peace.
Map/Summary/Nova08=Together with the Dominion and defectors from the Defenders of Man, Nova has repelled the Death Fleet's attack on Vardona. But Davis has taken advantage of the battle's chaos to escape from custody. Now Nova must track her down and bring her to justice once and for all.
Map/Summary/Nova09=The Defenders of Man have been defeated, and Davis is dead. Having disobeyed a direct order by killing her, Nova is now on the run. Despite her fugitive status, she stands ready to lead her crew in fighting for the Dominion on their own terms.</n></n>Through the efforts of one covert operative, a conspiracy that claimed countless innocent lives has been exposed and dismantled, and order has been restored. This concludes the story of Nova Covert Ops. Thank you for all you have done.
